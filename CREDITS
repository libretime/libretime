Version 1.4.0 - "Monrovia"
--------------------------
The great deal of the work on Campcaster 1.4 "Monrovia" was commissioned by the
Open Society Initiative for West Africa (www.osiwa.org), and by West Africa
Democracy Radio (www.wadr.org). We would like to thank Ben Akoh at OSIWA and
Peter Kahler at WADR for their immeasurable contributions to the project.

A number of improvements to Campcaster 1.4 were commissioned by Openbroadcast, a user-
generated radio station based in Basel, Switzerland powered by Campcaster. We are
very grateful for their contributions, and specifically to Thomas Gilgen, Dirk Claes,
Rigzen Latshang and Fabiano Sidler.

Version 1.0
-----------
The original Campcaster (LiveSupport) concept was drafted by Micz Flor. It was 
fully developed by Robert Klajn, Douglas Arellanes, Ákos Maróy, and Sava Tatić. 
The user interface has been designed by Charles Truett, based on the initial work 
done by a team of his then-fellow Parsons School of Design students Turi McKinley, 
Catalin Lazia and Sangita Shah. The team was led by then-head of the school's 
Department of Digital Design Colleen Macklin, assisted by Kunal Jain.
