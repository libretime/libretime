  *Changes
    -Support Settings moved to a seperate page accessible by Admin user only. 

1.9.0 - August 9, 2011

The cool stuff:
  * New file storage system.
    - Human-readable file structure.  The directory structure and file names on
      disk are now human-readable.  This means you can easily find files using
      your file browser on your server.
    - Magic file synchronization.  Edits to your files are automatically 
      noticed by Airtime. If you edit any files on disk, such as trimming the
      length of a track, Airtime will automatically notice this and adjust the
      playlist lengths and shows for that audio file.
    - Auto-import and multiple-directory support.  You can set any number of 
      directories to be watched by Airtime.  Any new files you add to watched 
      directories will be automatically imported into Airtime, and any deleted
      files will be automatically removed.
    - The "airtime-import" command line tool can now set watched directories 
      and change the storage directory.
    - Graceful recovery from reboot.  If the playout engine starts up and
      detects that a show should be playing at the current time, it will skip
      to the right point in the track and start playing.  Previously, Airtime 
      would not play anything until the next show started. This also fixes a 
      problem where the metadata on the stream was lost when a file had
      cue-in/out values set.  Thanks to the Liquidsoap developers for
      implementing the ability to do all of this!
    - Output to Shoutcast.  Now both Shoutcast and Icecast are supported.
    - A new "Program Manager" role.  A program manager can create shows but
      can't change the preferences or modify users.
    - No more rebooting after install!  Airtime now uses standard SystemV initd
      scripts instead of non-standard daemontools. This also makes for a much 
      faster install.
    - Frontend widgets are much easier to use and their theme can be modified 
      with CSS (Click here for more info and installation instructions).
    - Improved installation - only one command to install on Ubuntu!

  * Improvements:
    - Cumulative time shown on playlists.  The Playlist Builder now shows the 
      total time since the beginning of the playlist for each song.
    - "End Time" instead of "Duration".  In the Add/Edit Show dialog, we 
      replaced the "Duration" field with "End Time".  Users reported that this
      was a much more intuitive way to schedule the show.  Duration is still
      shown as a read-only field.
    - Feedback & promotion system.  Airtime now includes a way to send feedback
      and promote your site on the Sourcefabric web page. This will greatly 
      enhance our ability to understand who is using the software, which in 
      turn will allow us to make appropriate features and receive grant 
      funding.
    - The show recorder can now instantly cancel a show thanks to the use of
      RabbitMQ.
    - Only admins have the ability to delete files now.
    - The playout engine now runs with a higher priority. This should help 
      prevent any problems with audio skipping.
    - Airtime has been contained. It is now easier to run other apps on the
      same system with Airtime because it no longer messes with the system-wide
      Python or PHP configurations. The python libraries needed for Airtime are
      now contained in a local Python virtualenv, and the PHP config variables
      are set in the Apache virtualhost and .htaccess files.
    - Message indicating import status is now displayed on Playlist Builder
      page( above the search box).

  * Bug fixes:
    - Fixed bug where you couldn't import a file with a name longer than 255 
      characters.
    - Fixed bug where searching an audio archive of 15K+ files was slow.
    - Fixed bug where upgrading from more than one version back
      (e.g. 1.8.0 -> 1.9.0) did not work.
    - Fixed bug where the wrong file length was reported for very large CBR 
      mp3 files (thanks to mutagen developers for the patch!)

1.8.2 - June 8, 2011
Highlights:
  * Improvements:
    - You can now download audio files from the search screen and from the "Show Content" screen.
    - The "Now Playing" screen now shows whether a show is being recorded.
    - In the "Playlist Builder" screen, you can now edit the title of the playlist and the description inline, without having to switch to another page.
    - When you click on "Add Show", the cursor is placed on the show title field and a default name is automatically filled in.
    - It is now possible to cancel a show that was recording.
    - An new command-line program was added to verify an installation and help identify where problems are: "airtime-check-system"
    - Airtime now runs on Ubuntu 11.04 (though we do not offer support for this).
  * Bug fixes:
    - Fixed serious problem with the upgrading and installing process.  The Airtime install will now automatically detect if you should upgrade or install and take the appropriate action.  Reinstalls cannot happen except by using a specific command.
    - "Show Contents" screen will now display properly on smaller screens.
    - Install/uninstall now works on Debian without needing the "sudo" command.
    - Editing a playlist name or deleting a playlist now reflects immediately in the media search window.
    - In the "Add Media" page, the "start upload" button vanished after upload.  Now it remains there after upload so it is possible to upload again.
    - When canceling a playing show, the currently playing audio file still showed as playing.  This has been fixed.
    - Audio files greater than 100MB were not being played.
    - Fixed uploading audio on Chrome 11 and higher
    - Fixed various editing show problems
    - Fixed airtime-pypo-stop/start causing playback problems
    - Fixed incorrect information being occasionally shown in the top panel
    - Fixed problem with Record Check box occasionally being greyed-out when creating new show
    - Fixed a problem with default genre not being applied to recorded shows
    - Fixed a problem where shows repeating bi-weekly or monthly did not update properly when edited.
    - Fixed problem when a user changed the name of a recorded show right before it started playing would cause the recorded audio not to be linked to the show.
    - and many more...

1.8.1 - May 2, 2011
  * Fixed issue where an track's progress bar would keep updating, even if the track was no longer playing.
  * Fixed problem where editing a show would only update some of the show instances.
  * Fixed an issue related to editing a show that had instances scheduled in the past.
  * airtime-clean-storage command-line utility should now work properly
  * Fixed an issue related the "airtime-import" command-line utility
  * Fixed an issue with the Airtime Debian package overwriting configuration files
  * Fixed some database install issues on Debian
  * Fixed an issue with show names and foreign characters causing the show to not start (temporarily disabled allowing the usage of these characters)


1.8.0 - April 19, 2011
  * The biggest feature of this release is the ability to edit shows. You can
    change everything from ‘Name’, ‘Description’, and ‘URL’, to repeat and 
    rebroadcast days. Show instances will be dynamically created or removed as
    needed.  Radio stations will be pleased to know they can now have up to 
    ten rebroadcast shows too.
  * Airtime’s calendar now looks, feels and performs better than ever. Loading
    a station schedule is now five to eight times faster. In our tests of 1.7, 
    if the month calendar had shows scheduled for every hour of every day, it 
    used to take 16 seconds to load. Now in 1.8 it takes two seconds.
  * It is possible to have up to ten rebroadcast shows now, in 1.7 it was only
    up to five.
  * Airtime’s new installation script has two options for increased install 
    flexibility:  --preserve to keep your existing config files, or --overwrite 
    to replace your existing config files with new ones. Uninstall no longer 
    removes Airtime config files or the music storage directory.
  * New improved look & feel of the calendar (thanks to the "FullCalendar" 
    jQuery project).
  * Installation now puts files in standard locations in the Linux file 
    hierarchy, which prepares the project to be accepted into Ubuntu and Debian.
    Also because of our wish to be part of those projects, the default output 
    stream type is now OGG instead of MP3 -- due to MP3 licensing issues. 
    This configuration can be changed in "/etc/airtime/liquidsoap.conf".
  * You now have the ability to start and stop pypo and the show recorder from 
    the command line with the commands "airtime-pypo-start", 
    "airtime-pypo-stop", "airtime-show-recorder-start", and 
    "airtime-show-recorder-stop".
  * Bug fixes:
    - CC-2192 Schedule sent to pypo is not sorted by start time.
    - CC-2175 Overbooking: Cut off shows when they are done
    - CC-2174 Need formatting and a warning icon for the message for overbooking a show

  * Ability to cancel the currently playing show
  * Any changes to the schedule are immediately seen by the playout engine
    - In version 1.6, you had to make sure that your show was ready to go 30 seconds before it started.
  * Upgrade support (should be able to upgrade from any version, unlike 1.6.1 which required an uninstall of 1.6.0 first)
  * "Now Playing" list view:
    - audio items are now grouped by show.
    - If a show is not fully scheduled, the user is notified how many seconds of silence are at the end of the show in this View.
    - Audio items that play past the show's end time have a visual notification that they will be cut off
  * Ability to change metadata tag display format for web streams
  * Config files moved to /etc/airtime.  This means all config files are in one convenient location and separated from the code, so you can upgrade your code independently of your config files.
  * Redesign of Preferences screen
  * Bug fixes:
    - CC-2082 OGG stream dies after every song when using MPlayer
    - CC-1894 Warn users about time zone differences or clock drift problems on the server
