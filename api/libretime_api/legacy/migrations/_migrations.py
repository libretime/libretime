    Get the schema version from a legacy database.

    the legacy database schema to the point where django is in charge of the migrations.

    An airtime 2.5.1 migration will not have schema_version, in that case, we look for
    system_version to have a value of 2.5.1 and return that as the schema version value
    (really just needs to be anything besides None, so that the next migration doesn't overwrite
