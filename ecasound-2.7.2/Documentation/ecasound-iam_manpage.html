<h2>NAME</h2>ecasound-iam - ecasound interactive mode
<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Ecasound library contains an interpreter module that understands 
a set of commands aimed at controlling various library services. 
This is called the ecasound interactive mode (EIAM). All programs 
linked to ecasound library can use this facility.
<p>
<h2>ECI API and return types</h2>
A special case of interactive mode use is ecasound's control interface (ECI), 
which is a small library providing easy access to the interactive
mode commands from outside of libecasound. When issuing inter commands using 
the control interface, it's possible that commands also return information. 
Currently supported return value types are: string [s], list of strings [S] 
(elements separated by commas; escaped if necessary), integer [i], 
long integer [li] and floating-point number [f]. These definitions are 
used throughout this document. Commands that return nothing (void) are 
marked with [-]. Additionally, return type [e] marks an error condition. 
When an interactive mode command results in an error, an error string 
explaining the condition is returned.
<p>
<h2>Real-time commands</h2>
It's not possible to use all interactive mode commands to modify and 
control objects that belong to a connected chainsetup. Commands that 
do NOT support this are: 
<p>
<blockquote>
   cs-remove, cs-set-length, cs-set-length-samples, cs-toggle-loop, 
   cs-set-param,  cs-option,  
   c-add,  c-remove, c-rename, c-clear,  
   ai-add, ai-remove, ai-attach,  ai-forward, ai-rewind,  ai-set-position,  
   ai-set-position-samples,  
   ao-add, ao-add-default,  ao-remove,  ao-attach,  ao-forward, ao-rewind,  
   ao-set-position,  ao-set-position-samples.
</blockquote>
<p>
If one of these commands is issued when a chainsetup is connected,
ecasound will first stop and disconnect the chainsetup, process
the command, and the reconnect.
<p>
In addition, most non-modifying (const) commands work with 
connected setups.
<p>
<h2>GENERAL</h2>
<dl>
<p><dt><strong>quit, q</strong><dd>
Quit ecasound session. What this means in practice depends on the 
client implementation. In ecasound interactive mode, 'quit' terminates
the ecasound process. When sent over ecasound server connection (aka 
NetECI), 'quit' terminates the active network connection, but does not 
terminate the ecasound server process. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>start, t</strong><dd>
Processing is started (play). Error string is return if any errors upon 
startup are encountered. <em>[e]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>stop, s</strong><dd>
Stop processing. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>run</strong><dd>
Like 'start' but blocks until processing is finished. Error string
is return if any errors upon startup, or during process, are 
encountered. <em>[e]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>debug 'debug-level'</strong><dd>
Set debug level to 'debug-level'. Notice that client programs can
reimplement the debug routines. <em>[-]</em>
</dl>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>resource-file 'path-to-file'</strong><dd>
Overrides the global and user resource files. Does not affect
already created objects. This command is equivalent to '-R' ecasound 
option (see ecasound (1) man page). 
<p>
<p><dt><strong>-prefix:arg1,...,argN</strong><dd>
Equivalent to issuing 'cs-option -prefix:arg1,...,argN). See documentation
for 'cs-option'.
<p>
<p><dt><strong>help', 'h'</strong><dd>
Help! <em>[-]</em>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<h2>GLOBAL</h2>
<p>
<dl>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>engine-status</strong><dd>
Returns a string describing the engine status (running, stopped,
finished, error, not ready). See also <em>cs-status</em>. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>engine-launch</strong><dd>
Starts the real-time engine. Engine will execute the currently
connected chainsetup (see 'cs-connect). This action does not yet
start actual processing (see <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em>). When
ecasound is used as a JACK client, issuing <em>engine-launch</em> 
makes ecasound an active JACK client (i.e. ecasound's ports
can be connected to other JACK clients). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>engine-halt</strong><dd>
Stops the engine. Does not disconnect the chainsetup that 
was running. See also <em>cs-disconnet</em> and <em>stop</em>. When
ecasound is used as a JACK client, <em>engine-halt</em> will 
cause ecasound to become a deactivated client (all JACK
connections are torn down). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<h2>CHAINSETUPS</h2>
Chainsetup is the central data object. All other objects (inputs,
outputs, chains, etc) are connected to some chainsetup. There can be 
many chainsetups but only one can be connected. Similarly only
one chainsetup can be selected. If not otherwise specified operations 
are done on the selected chainsetup. Some operations also require
that selected chainsetup is not connected.
<p>
<dl>
<p><dt><strong>cs-add 'name'</strong><dd>
Adds a new chainsetup with name 'name'. 'name' is now 
the selected chainsetup. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-remove</strong><dd> 
Removes currently selected chainsetup. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-list</strong><dd>
Returns a list of all chainsetups. <em>[S]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-select 'name'</strong><dd>
Selects chainsetup 'name'. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-selected</strong><dd>
Returns the name of currently selected chainsetup. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-index-select 'cs_index', cs-iselect 'cs_index'</strong><dd>
Selects a chainsetup based on a short index string. Chainsetup names
can be rather long. This command can be used to avoid typing
these long names. 'cs_index' is an integer value, where '1' refers to 
the first audio input/output. You can use 'cs-list' and 'cs-status' 
to get a full list of currently available chainsetups. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-load 'filename'</strong><dd>
Adds a new chainsetup by loading it from file 'filename'. 
'filename' is now the selected chainsetup. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-save</strong><dd> 
Saves the currently selected chainsetup to file. If chainsetup was loaded
from a file, the saved version will replace the original. If it doesn't 
have a default filename, it's saved to "chainsetup_name.ecs". <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-save-as 'filename'</strong><dd>
Saves currently selected chainsetup to file 'filename'. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-edit</strong><dd> 
Currently selected chainsetup is saved to a temporary file. This
file is loaded to an external editor (see ecasoundrc (5)). After
editing, the chainsetup is loaded back to ecasound. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-is-valid</strong><dd>
Whether currently selected chainsetup is valid (=can be connected)? <em>[i]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-connect</strong><dd>
Connect currently selected chainsetup to engine. When connecting, 
all resources (e.g. files, soundcard devices, external programs) needed 
to execute the chainsetup are reserved. Only one chainsetup can be connected 
at a time. Error string is returned if connection fails (for instance
due to error in allocating the resources). <em>[e]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-disconnect</strong><dd>
Disconnect currently connected chainsetup. This action will free
all external resources needed by the chainsetup. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-connected</strong><dd>
Returns the name of currently connected chainsetup. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-rewind 'time-in-seconds', rewind 'time-in-seconds', rw 'time-in-seconds'</strong><dd>
Rewinds the current chainsetup position by 'time-in-seconds' seconds.
Position of all inputs and outputs attached to the selected chainsetup
is also affected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-forward 'time-in-seconds', forward 'time-in-seconds', fw 'ttime-in-seconds'</strong><dd>
The current chainsetup position is forwarded by 'time-in-seconds'
seconds. Position of all inputs and outputs attached to the selected chainsetup
is also affected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-position 'time-in-seconds', cs-setpos 'time-in-seconds', setpos 'time-in-seconds', set-position 'time-in-seconds'</strong><dd>
Sets the chainsetup position to 'time-in-seconds' seconds from the 
beginning. Position of all inputs and outputs attached to the selected 
chainsetup is also affected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-position-samples 'time-in-samples'</strong><dd>
Sets the chainsetup position to 'time-in-samples' samples from the 
beginning. Position of all inputs and outputs attached to the selected 
chainsetup is also affected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-get-position, cs-getpos, getpos, get-position</strong><dd>
Returns the current chainsetup position in seconds. <em>[f]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-get-position-samples</strong><dd>
Returns the current chainsetup position in samples. <em>[li]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-get-length, get-length</strong><dd>
Returns the chainsetup length in seconds (if known). <em>[f]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-get-length-samples, get-length-samples</strong><dd>
Returns the chainsetup length in samples (if known). <em>[li]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-length 'seconds'</strong><dd>
Sets processing time in seconds (doesn't have to be an integer value). 
A special-case value of '-1' will set the chainsetup length 
according to the longest input object. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-length-samples 'samples'</strong><dd>
Sets processing time in samples. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-toggle-loop</strong><dd>
Toggle looping. When processing is finished, engine will start 
again from the initial position. It's not always possible to enable looping
(for instance all inputs and outputs have infinite length and
chainsetup length is not explicitly set with 'cs-set-length'). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-param</strong><dd>
Interpret general chainsetup parameters like for example
"-b" (buffersize), "-n" (name), etc. See ecasound (1) for 
more info. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-set-audio-format 'bits,channels,sample_rate'</strong><dd>
Set the default sample parameters for currently selected chainsetup. 
For example cd-quality audio would be "16,2,44100". This does the
same as command-line argument "-f" (see ecasound (1)). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-status, status, st</strong><dd>
Prints out status information about available chainsetup.
Detailed information is printed out for connected (=available
for running) nd selected (=available for editing) chainsetups.
Other chainsetups are listed, but further details are
suppressed. To get full details of a specific chainsetup,
select it with 'cs-select' or 'cs-iselect', and then
issue 'cs-select'. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cs-option '-prefix:arg1,...,argN'</strong><dd>
One powerful feature of the interactive-mode is that it
provides full access to ecasound's command-line syntax. 
For instance, command "cs-option -efb:400,200" means that 
a bandpass filter is added to the currently selected 
chain, with initial parameters 400 (center frequency) 
and 200 (width in Hz).
<p>
Note that session level options (such as setting debug level)
can not be used with 'cs-option' (i.e. only options that modify
chainsetups).
<p>
Note! Ecasound interactive mode implicitly interprets all strings 
beginning with a '-' as "cs-option string".
</dl>
<p>
<h2>CHAINS</h2>
Chain is a simple signal flow abstraction. Every chain has one input
and one output. All chain operators and their controllers are attached
to chains. Chains can be muted, unmuted and be bypassed. If not 
otherwise stated, all operations are done to currently selected
chainsetup.
<p>
<dl>
<p><dt><strong>c-add 'cname1,...,cnameN'</strong><dd> 
Adds a set of chains. Added chains are automatically selected. Note
that commas in chain names are not allowed. <em>[-]</em>

<p><dt><strong>c-select 'cname1,...,cnameN'</strong><dd>
Selects chains. Other chains are automatically deselected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-index-select 'index1,...,indexN', c-iselect 'index1,...,indexN'</strong><dd>
Selects a set of chains based on the list of indixes. Each index is
an integer value, where '1' refers to the first chain. You can use 
'c-list' and 'c-status' to get a full list of currently available 
chains. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-select-all</strong><dd>
Selects all chains. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-select-add 'cname1,...,cnameN'</strong><dd>
Selects more chains. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-deselect 'cname1,...,cnameN'</strong><dd>
Deselects chains. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-selected</strong><dd>
Returns a list of selected chains. <em>[S]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-clear</strong><dd>
Clear selected chains by removing all chain operators and controllers.
Doesn't change how chains are connected to inputs and outputs. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-rename 'new_name'</strong><dd>
Renames the selected chain. When using this command, exactly one chain must
be selected. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-muting, c-mute</strong><dd>
Toggle chain muting. When chain is muted, all data that goes through
is muted. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-bypass</strong><dd>
Toggle chain bypassing. When chain is bypassed, sample data is passed 
through unprocessed (all chain operators are disabled for the given
chain). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>c-status, cs</strong><dd>
Print status info about all chains. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
</dl>
<p>
<h2>AUDIO INPUT/OUTPUT OBJECTS</h2>
If not otherwise stated, all operations are done to currently selected
object. All commands with <em>ai-</em> prefix operate on audio inputs,
while commands with <em>ao-</em> operate on outputs.
<p>
<dl>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-add 'input_format_string'</strong><dd>
Adds a new input object. See ecasound (1) man page for more info about 
the argument format ('-i' option). Note on syntax: if any of 
the parameters (such as a filename) contains commas, the parameter 
should be enclosed in double-quotes. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ao-add 'output_format_string'</strong><dd>
Adds a new output object. See ecasound (1) man page for more info about 
the argument format ('-o' option). If argument is omitted, 
a default output device is added (see ecasoundrc (5)). Note on syntax: if any 
of the parameters (such as a filename) contains commas, the parameter 
should be enclosed in double-quotes. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ao-add-default</strong><dd>
Adds the default output device (see ecasoundrc (5)). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-describe, ao-describe</strong><dd>
Returns a Ecasound Option Syntax (EOS) compliant string
describing the input/output. See the Ecasound User's Guide
for more information about EOS. This command was introduced in 
ecasound 2.4.4. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-select 'aobject_name', ao-select 'aobject_name'</strong><dd>
Selects an audio object. 'aobject_name' refers to the string
used when creating the object (the first argument given to ai-add/ao-add). 
Note that as a important difference to ai-add/ao-add, one should not 
enclose the object name in double quotes for ai-select/ao-select. In the 
case a chainsetup contains multiple inputs, or outputs, with 
identical name, 'ai-select' and 'ao-select' will select 
the first matching instance. In order to select a specific
instance, the 'ai-iselect' and 'ao-iselect' commands need to 
be used. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-index-select 'aobject_index', ai-iselect 'aobject_index', ao-index-select 'aobject_index', ao-iselect 'aobject_index'</strong><dd>
Select some audio object based on a short index string. Especially file
names can be rather long. This command can be used to avoid typing
these long names when selecting audio objects. 'aobject_index' is
an integer value, where '1' refers to the first audio input/output. 
You can use 'ai-list' and 'ao-list' to get a full list of currently
available inputs/outputs. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-selected, ao-selected</strong><dd>
Returns the name of the currently selected audio object. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-attach, ao-attach</strong><dd>

<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-forward 'time_in_seconds', ai-fw 'time_in_seconds', ao-forward 'time_in_seconds', ao-fw 'time_in_seconds'</strong><dd>
Selected audio object is forwarded by 'time-in-seconds' seconds. 
Time should be given as a floating point value (eg. 0.001 is the 
same as 1ms). <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ai-rewind 'time_in_seconds', ai-rw 'time_in_seconds', ao-rewind 'time_in_seconds', ao-rw 'time_in_seconds'</strong><dd>
Selected audio object is rewinded by 'time-in-seconds' seconds. 
Time should be given as a floating point value (eg. 0.001 is the 
same as 1ms). <em>[-]</em>

<p>
</dl>
<p>
<h2>CHAIN OPERATORS</h2>
Chain operators are used to process and analyze sample data.
They are attached to chains. If not otherwise stated,
currently selected chainsetup and chain are used. Also, 
'chainop_id' and 'param_id' are used to select chain operators 
and their parameters. First valid value for these parameters 
is 1.
<p>
<dl>
<p><dt><strong>cop-add 'cop_format_string'</strong><dd>
Adds a new chain operator. In addition to normal chain operators, 
this commmand can also be used to add effect presets and various 
plugins. Note; it is not possible to add operators to multiple
chains at once. In other words only one chain should be selected
when issuing 'cop-add'.  See ecasound (1) man page for more info. <em>[-]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>cop-describe</strong><dd>
Returns a Ecasound Option Syntax (EOS) compliant string

<h2>CONTROLLERS</h2>
Controllers are used to control individual chain operator parameters.
They are attached to chains. If not otherwise stated, currently 
selected chainsetup and chains are used. 
<p>
<p><dt><strong>ctrl-add 'copc_format_string'</strong><dd>
Adds a new controller and attach it to currently selected chain 
operator. The argument syntax is either "-&lt;id_string&gt;:par1,...,parN" 
or just "&lt;id_string&gt;:par1,...,parN". If parameter itself contains 
commas, the parameter should be enclosed in double-quotes.
See ecasound (1) man page for more info. <em>[-]</em>

<h2>JACK CONNECTION MANAGEMENT</h2>
If Ecasound is compiled with support for <a href="http://jackaudio.org/">JACK audio server</a>,
the following set of commands is provided for controlling connections 
between JACK ports.
<p>

<h2>OBJECT MAPS</h2>
Object maps are central repositories for commonly used object types.
By querying the maps, applications can get a list of all registered
object types and their properties. 
<p>
<dl>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>map-cop-list</strong><dd>
Prints a list of registered chain operators using 
the format specified in section <em>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</em>. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>map-preset-list</strong><dd>
Prints a list of registered effect presets using 
the format specified in section <em>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</em>. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>map-ladspa-list</strong><dd>
Prints a list of registered LADSPA plugins using 
the format specified in section <em>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</em>. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>map-ladspa-id-list</strong><dd>
Prints a list of registered LADSPA plugins using 
the format specified in section <em>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</em>. 
Numerical LADPSA plugin identifiers are used. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
<p><dt><strong>map-ctrl-list</strong><dd>
Prints a list of registered controllers using 
the format specified in section <em>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</em>. <em>[s]</em>
<p>
</dl>

<p>
<h2>OPERATOR DESCRIPTIONS</h2>
The <em>map-xxx-list</em> commands return a string containing all registered
objects of the given type <em>xxx</em>. Each line of the output describes
one registered type. The used syntax is:
<p>
'keyword,name,description,num_of_params,par1_def,par2_def,...'
<p>
<em>parX_def</em> describes one object parameter. This definition
is present for all parameters of the described object type.
The used syntax is:
<p>
'name,description,defaultvalue,upper_bound_flag,upper_bound,
lower_bound_flag,lower_bound,toggled_flag,integer_flag,
logarithmic_flag,output_flag'
<p>
