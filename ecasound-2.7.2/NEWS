19082010 (v2.7.2) -** stable release **-
	 - added: manual gate (-gm); see ecasound(1) man page
	 - changed: liboil now enabled by default if the library 
	   	    development files are available when running
		    configure
	 - fixed: bug with 'resample' objects and early seeks (e.g.
	   	  with '-y' offsets); reported by Artur
         - fixed: bugs in kvutils that broke some old/non-glibc 
	   	  builds (e.g. cygwin); bug reported by Al Oomens
         - fixed: bugs in saving chainsetups with stacked audio
	   	  objects ("audioloop", "select", "playat")
20022010 (v2.7.1) -** stable release **-
	- note: key changes are described in more detail at:
                http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_7_1_relnotes.txt
	- fixed: glitches in ALSA capture/playback with some sound 
	  	 hardware/configurations, and using alsa-lib
	    	 older than 1.0.15; related to deprecated ALSA API
		 function snd_pcm_sw_params_set_xfer_align()
        - fixed: bug in removing audio objects when disk double
	  	 buffering is used (-z:db); could cause a segfault
		 in some scenarios (e.g. with ecasignalview)
        - fixed: interactive mode; c-selected segfauls if issued
	    	 with no chainsetup selected
        - fixed: build errors when no liblo is available
	- fixed: interactive-mode; cs-setpos, cs-rewind and cs-forward
	    	 did not work if chainsetup was connected, and no
		 chains (or an invalid chain) was selected; bug 
		 reported by Joel Roth
        - fixed: ecalength choked filenames with whitespace; patch
	  	 from FUJI project
		 (http://students.mimuw.edu.pl/~tk197881/a8cas/)
17102009 (v2.7.0) -** stable release **-
	- note: key changes are described in more detail at:
                http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_7_0_relnotes.txt
	- added: new exit code of '4' to ecasound; see entry below
		 about signal handling changes and ecasound(1) for
		 more details
	- added: -eadb chainop, like -ea/-eac, but gain given in dB;
		 documented in ecasound(1)
	- added: -chorder chainop; see ecasound(1)
	- added: optional inner loop optimizations using liboil;
		 enable with '--enable-liboil'
        - added: OSC support added, see ecasound(1) and 
	         Documentation/ecasound_osc_interface.txt; sffeat:2541462
	- added: in ncurses mode, honor COLUMNS environment variable
	- added: configure - added '--with-extra-cppflags' and 
	         '--with-extra-libs' options
        - added: new 'cop-get' command; see ecasound-iam(1) [alinson]
	- changed: ecasound now defines "-D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500" for 
	           all builds, expressing that the codebase expects 
		   the build environment be compatible with the Single 
		   UNIX Spec v2 (1998); thanks to Jussi Laako for
		   reminding about this
	- changed: yet another change to signal handling in ecasound;
		   now two level response to signals is supported in
		   all stages of process termination -> first starting
		   normal cleanup and exit procudere, and with
		   second signal terminate immediately; see ecasound(1)
		   for the full story (new 'SIGNALS' section)
	- changed: dropped "-funroll-loops" from the set of default
		   compiler options
	- changed: comment out many entries in the global installed
		   'ecasoundrc' file (entries are redundant as the same
	 	   defaults are already set in the program binaries)
	- changed: optimized inner loops in core chain routing and
		   mixdown functions (with liboil if available)
	- changed: optimized inner loops of -ea, -eadb, -eac, and -epp 
	- changed: dropped tracking of 'clipped samples' from -ev as
		   the results were of little use (and misleading)
	- changed: '-ev' status output
	- changed: cosmetic changes to the default ncurses trace output;
		   reduced number of subsystem-level trace messages 
	- changed: the name for default chainsetup created from command 
	           line is now "untitled-chainsetup"
	- changed: do not automatically connect chainsetups loaded
		   with '-s'
	- fixed: mp3 output was broken with lame 3.98 (and newer); 
		 the default lame parameters have now been updated 
		 and have been tested with lame 3.96, 3.97 and with
		 the latest 3.98.2
	- fixed: bad audio with 'resample' object, non-integer sampling 
		 rate change ratios and output to JACK; ecasound did
		 emit warning about this, but did not raise a fatal 
		 error; now the underlying problem is fixed and now
		 'resample' and 'jack' objects maybe safely used 
		 together
        - fixed: minor bug in ecamonitor; "cop-status" was used with
		 multiple chains selected
	- fixed: don't use '--ignore-fail-on-non-empty' rmdir option
		 as it is not available on many platforms (e.g. OS X)
		 and this breaks the uninstall target; sfbug:2772628
	- fixed: bug in ecasound frontend parser for '-E' option that
		 broken passing arguments containing the substring 
 		 "-E"; introduced in 2.5.2 release
        - fixed: stale audio was written to JACK output ports in case
	   	 of multiple streams, connected to different JACK ports,
		 reaching end-of-stream at different times [jedahu]
08022009 (v2.6.0) -** stable release **-
	- note: key changes are described in more detail at:
                http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_6_0_relnotes.txt
	- added: new optional params to 'jack' -> 'jack,clientname,portprefix';
		 replaces old interfaces 'jack_auto', 'jack_generic' 
		 and 'jack_alsa'; see ecasound(1) for more details
	- added: interactive mode - new commands 'jack-connect', 
		 'jack-disconnect' and 'jack-list-connections'; see 
		 ecasound-iam(1) for details; closes sffeat:2134183
	- added: 'jack_multi', see ecasound(1); closes sffeat:1415822
	- added: ecasound options '--server', '--server-tcp-port' and
		 '--no-server'; these replace the misleading old
		 options '--daemon', '--nodaemon' and '--daemon-port', 
		 which are now deprecated
	- added: extended unit tests to cover option parsing, with
		 some initial test cases
        - added: unit test framework - minor improvements including
		 abilitity to select which cases to run
	- added: ECI - functions eci_ready() and eci_ready_r() added
		 to ecasoundc.h, and ECA_CONTROL_INTERACE::ready()
		 to the C++ API
	- changed: deprecated 'jack_auto', 'jack_generic' and
	           'jack_alsa'
	- changed: numbering of JACK ports created with 'jack' and
	 	   'jack_generic' starts from "_1" separately for 
		   each prefix [dsacre]
        - changed: deprecated 'ai-wave-edit', 'ao-wave-edit' commands
		   and the 'ext-cmd-wave-editor' ecasoundrc field
	- changed: emit a 'subsystem' level trace message when 
	 	   engine state changes to finished
	- changed: interactive mode - minor update to 'status' command
	  	   output
	- changed: compile libecasoundc as PIC code to make it possible
		   to use it from shared libraries; fixes problems 
		   with e.g. Audio::Ecasound on amd64 architecture ;
		   closes sfbug:2505551
	- changed: ecasound option -f now accepts empty arguments for 
		   sample format, channel count and sampling rate; empty
		   argument states that ecasound can pick a suitable
		   value, either the default value or e.g. the JACK 
		   system sampling rate; updated documentation, see
		   ecasound(1)
        - changed: minor update to ecasound's "--help"
	- changed: when reading RIFF WAVE files, properly ignore 
		   any unknown subchunk types
	- changed: largefile support (+2GiB files) is now enabled
		   by default and configure uses's default autoconf
		   macro AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to perform the checks; 
		   to explicitly disable, use '--disable-largefile';
		   the old '--with-largefile' no longer has any effect
	- changed: refactored ECI C impl code to get rid of all
		   fixed size buffers from the parser; this makes
		   the implementation more robust, reduces memory
		   usage and provides a small speed-up to most ECI
		   apps; closes sfbug:1412409
	- fixed: do not limit max-gain reported by '-ev' to [1,max]
		 value range
        - fixed: avoid denormal numbers in '-ete' (leads to unusually
		 high CPU load)
	- fixed: 'dump-cop-value' did not work as documented
	- fixed: ECI - signal an error (e.g. eci_error() returns true)
		 if connection is lost to engine process (sync lost
	 	 or an other error)
	- fixed: ecasignalview - exit if engine reports an error
		 during operation
	- fixed: interactive mode - loop devices saved with incorrect 
		 syntax, affects cs-save, cs-save-as and cs-edit ; see
	 	 http://eca.cx/ecasound-list/2009/01/0058.html
	- fixed: problems when seeking back to start with setups using
		 loop devices; closes sfbug:2527049
	- fixed: segfault if using a tone generator input with a fixed
		 lenght, and a seek past the end of stream was performed
        - fixed: aac/ogg/mikmod/mid inputs - once object reached state 
		 'finished' (all samples played), it cannot be played 
		 again by reconnecting the chainsetup
	- fixed: combination of '--server' and '-C' (disable interactive
		 mode) had a bug that prevented processing of commands
		 received over the server socket while the engine 
		 was running the batchmode
	- fixed: a nasty bug in 'playat' implementation causing audible
		 artifacts ; see 
		 http://eca.cx/ecasound-list/2009/01/0089.html
	- fixed: sndfile and audiofile backends - emit a warning if 
		 a seek fails (e.g. when seeking beyond current 
		 end-of-file for output objects)
	- fixed: various improvements and fixes related to using
		 non-seekable audio objects (especially interactive
 		 use); in most cases this means graceful recovery 
	 	 from failed seek attempts, and correct reporting of
	 	 the objects actual current position
        - fixed: error is emitted if trying to use 'select' with
		 objects that do not support seeking
        - fixed: bugs with passing 'auto' as the 2nd parameter of 
		 'resample'
	- fixed: bug with seeking resampled audio objects
	- fixed: bug in combined use of 'audioloop' and 'resample'
	- fixed: catch and warn about various errors cases when
		 given incorrect or missing params to audio 
		 types: typeselect, resample, reverse, playat, 
		 audioloop, select
24082008 (v2.5.2) -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_5_2_relnotes.txt
	- fixed: bug in channel routing of LADSPA plugins that have
		 more audio output ports than input ports
21082008 (v2.5.1) -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_5_1_relnotes.txt
	- fixed: a last minute change in 2.5.0 that caused build errors
	 	 with gcc-4.3.1 if ALSA support is disabled
	- fixed: a change in 2.5.0 how process cleanup is initiated from 
		 the signal handler caused severe problems on some 
		 systems when ecasound was interrupted with e.g. 
	         ctrl-c/SIGINT; worst case was a crashed X session which
	         is of course really, really bad
 	- fixed: a bug in registering LADSPA plugins; on some systems
	         not all found plugins were registered properly to
	 	 ecasound's object maps causing some plugins to be
		 unusable;  errors 
16082008 (v2.5.0) -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_5_0_relnotes.txt
	- notice: slightly modified the version numbering scheme -
		  minor version is incremented whenever non-trivial
		  new features are added
	- notice: verified to compile with minimal warnings with
	          gcc-4.3.1
	- edi-entries: edi-40 closed (Update to error and warning 
	               reporting mechanisms), edi-38 closed (see
		       edi-7 partially implemented
	- added: ecasound.el: added missing ECI commands cs-option, 
	         cs-set-length, cs-set-position-samples, ai-get-length,
		 ai-set-position, and ai-set-position-samples [dto,
	  	 mlang]
        - added: tone generator input; '-i:tone,sine,440,10.3' will 
		 create a 440Hz sine tone with duration of 10.3 seconds;
		 this input type will be especially useful for reproducing
	 	 bugs in complicated chainsetups, without the need to
		 exchange complete session data (which usually are composed
		 of large amounts of audio data)
        - added: audio looper object; "-i:audioloop,foo.wav" will play
		 'foo.wav' and loop it indefinitely
        - added: audio selector object; "-i:select,5,15.2,foo.wav" will 
		 play 15.2sec of "foo.wav", starting at position 5sec;
		 relates to (edi-7)
	- added: audio play-at object; "-i:playat,5,foo.wav" will
		 start playing "foo.wav" after position reaches 5sec
	- added: EWF files; ability to specify positions in time in 
		 sample frames; "2.0" is interpreted as 2.0secs while
	         "88200sa" is interpreted as 88200 samples
	- added: 'reopen-count' parameter to threshold gate (-ge);
		 for instance when recording vinyl/tapes, this allows
		 to automatically restart recording when a new track 
		 is started [andrewl]
	- added: ecasound frontend option '-E "cmds"' that allows
	 	 to run a set of interactive mode commands at
		 startup; see ecasound(1) for details; closes (edi-38)
	- added: a notice is printed in case audio object's audio 
		 format parameters differ from the chainsetup's default
		 values (audio object's own params always override
		 any value set by e.g. '-f:...').
        - changed: most of the EWF support (Ecasound Wave Files, .ewf) 
		   has been rewritten in this version; numerous bugs
	  	   are fixed
        - changed: eaim - commands 'cop-add' and 'ctrl-add' now allow
		   an alternate syntax: both "-<id_string>:par1,...,parN"
		   and "<id_string>:par1,...,parN" are now accepted
        - changed: ability to write to EWF file is now marked as 
	           a deprecated feature which will be removed in
	           a later release 
	- changed: mechanism to terminate forked child processes; 
		   properly wait for process termination in all 
		   circumstances (previously there were some 
		   unhandled corner cases)
	- changed: major updates to the examples.html page (available
	           also at http://eca.cx/examples )
	- changed: refactored logic for propagating seek events 
		   across chainsetups; warnings are now issued if 
		   one tries to seek objects that do not supports
		   seeking; similarly warning is issued if a given
	 	   audio object type doesn't support sample accurate
		   seeks (for example mp3 inputs have this limitation)
        - changed: updated ecasound(1) man page description of '-klg'
	- changed: separate global (-d, -R, ...) and ecasound frontend 
		   specific (-c, --daemon, -s, ...) options in 
		   ecasound(1) man page
        - changed: changes to "cs-status" (aka "status", "st")
		   output formatting; now more information about
	           selected and connected setups is printed out
  	- changed: minor changes to the information printed out when
		   open audio input/outputs
	- changed: pipes, sockets and device nodes in LADSPA plugin
		   directories are skipped (previously hidden files 
		   were already skipped)
	- changed: loop device identifier was changed from an integer
	 	   to a generic string; both "-i:loop,1" and 
		   "-i:loop,myloop" are now valid
        - fixed: incorrect usage of the Python C API, which leads to
	 	 segfaults when pyecasound is used under python2.5;
		 fixes Debian bug #468965
        - fixed: bugs in ewf-looping code
	- fixed: avoid terminating processing when invalid parameters are 
		 passed to channel copy (chcopy/erc), mix (chmix/erm) and 
	         move (chmove) chainops
	- fixed: eaim - buffering mode was sometimes incorrectly 
		 reported in 'cs-status' output (-B:auto instead of 
		 the actual set buffering mode) output; bug reported by 
		 Jan Weil
        - fixed: compilation warnings from GCC-4.3; fixes Debian bug
	         #454890, patch from Cyril Brulebois
	- fixed: bug in passing multiple arguments to 'typeselect', 
	         'resample', and 'resample' objects
	- fixed: with some glibc versions (tested with 2.3.6.ds1-13etch5),
		 ecasound did not fully clean up all threads when
		 it received a signal and terminated; the bug showed
	  	 up as a stuck thread, with backtrace pointing to
	  	 pthread_onexit_process()
	- fixed: compilation issue on Mac OS X 10.5 [grobian]
	- fixed: bug in saving control state with 'cs-save' or
	         'cs-save-as'; triggered if controller was followed
		 by more chainops on the same chain
	- fixed: bugs with preserving state across seeks with
	         many controller objects (-kl, -kl2 and -kos)
	- fixed: a bug in ecasound user's guide w.r.t. usage of 
		 loop devices
	- fixed: sloppy parsing of "-i:loop" and "-o:loop" arguments
		 leading to confusing error messages when invalid input/output
		 objects, containing the substring "loop" were passed
	 	 as arguments to "-i" and "-o"
14082007 (v2.4.6.1) -** stable release **-
 	- fixed: extra debugging, printed to stderr, for resource file 
		 values was accidentally left enabled in the 2.4.6 release
14082007 (v2.4.6)  -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_4_6_relnotes.txt
	- added: new option '-R:path-to-resource-file' to use a custom
		 resource file and disable querying of global and user
		 resource files; as a special case, by setting this 
		 to '/dev/null', one disable all access to resource 
		 files; requested by Klaus Schulz and Keith Creasy
	- added: eiam - new command 'resource-file'; see ecasoundrc(5)
		 man page; related to previous item
        - changed: license of rubyecasound, the Ruby ECI API 
                 implementation, has been changed from GPL to LGPL
	- fixed: build errors caused by missing #includes, reported
		 by GCC 4.3; bug report from Debian, bug #417178
	- fixed: rounding errors with small buffersizes caused time crop 
                 gate (-gc) to function incorrectly; reported by Joe 
		 Planisky
        - fixed: force localization of decimal numbers to "POSIX" (i.e.
	         use period as the separator) to avoid bugs with 
	         e.g. LADSPA plugins that call setlocale and break 
		 the ecasound option parser; for instance all swh-plugins
	  	 call setlocale; reported by Rémi Rouaud
        - fixed: printing chain operator (e.g. the '-ev' operator) status 
	         at end of sessions was broken in 2.4.5; reported by
	 	 Julien Claassen
	- fixed: bugs that led to infinitely running chainsetups when
		 loop input/outputs were used; reported by Aaron Heller
	  	 and Etienne Deleflie
	- fixed: incorrect page numbers in table of contents of 
	  	 the Ecasound Programmer's and User's Guides; patch 
	 	 from Junichi Uekawa
	- fixed: segfault when removing a chain operator with multiple
		 associated controllers; reported by Adam Linson
07122006 (v2.4.5)  -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_4_5_relnotes.txt
	- added: ability to compile without a readline library (will
	         disable the curses based console user-interface)
	- added: if libsndfile is found and supports flac (sndfile
	         1.0.12 or newer), it will be used as the default
	  	 handler for flac files; use of sndfile makes random 
		 access for flac files possible (for example seeking 
		 in interactive mode)
	- added: section on 'RETURN VALUES' to ecasound(1) man page
	- added: ecasound-iam(1) - added documentation for error 
		 return values for 'run', 'start' and 'cs-connect'
	- added: ECASOUND_LOGFILE and ECASOUND_LOGLEVEL environment
	         variables; see ecasound(1) for documentation
	- added: more detailed description of debug levels that
	         can be set with 'd' to ecasound(1) manpage
	- added: examples section to ecasound(1), which points to
	         the examples page at eca.cx/ecasound
	- added: new chain operators '-chmove' and '-chmute'
 	- added: new aliases for chain operators: '-chmix' for '-erm',
		 and '-chcopy' for '-erc'
	- added: ability to protect EOS arguments, like filenames, with 
	         double quotes, closes bug #1456510; see also the related 
	         BUGS entry about handling commas in filenames, and 
		 updated documentation in ecasound(1), ecasond-iam(1)
		 and the User's Guide
	- removed: readline-4.0 subdir from the dist package; system
	           readline library is now the only build option
	- changed: ecasoundrc - added "-f" to the default flac 
		   output exec command (although now libsndfile's 
	           flac support is the default)
	- changed: improved libsndfile integration, any libsndfile
		   supported file format can be used as output for
	           'sndfile,foo.ext' (format selected based on filename
		   extension)
	- changed: eiam - default int-log-history length set to zero
	- changed: updated config.guess and config.sub to more recent
		   versions (timestamp 2006-07-02)
	- changed: updated the documentation for 'ai-select/ao-select',
		   it is no longer required that input/outputs have
	 	   a unique name within one chainsetup; problem reported 
                   by Kurt Konolige
        - changed: replaced the ECI C implementation's (libecasoundc) 
                   engine cleanup mechanism with a much more robust one
        - changed: the engine will now refuse to start if a start offset
		   is given with '-y:secs' for an object not supporting
		   seeking; this has been a very common source of 
		   end-user confusion
	- fixed: segfault when removing loop devices with a[io]-remove,
	 	 reported by Pedro Antonio Fructuoso Merino
	- fixed: incorrect headers in created flac files (not related
		 to sndfile/flac); fix can possibly affect other file 
		 formats handled by external apps (aac, midi, mikmod,

07082005 (v2.4.2)  -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_4_2_relnotes.txt

08042005 (v2.4.1)  -** stable release **-
	- more verbose description of change available at:
                 http://eca.cx/relnotes/ecasound_v2_4_1_relnotes.txt
	- note: verified to work with automake versions 1.6 and 1.9;

	- fixed: current position of the time crop gate (-gc) was 
		 incorrecly increased [alexey]
	- fixed: compilation failed if building outside srcdir

		 in eci_cleanup(); for example playing thousands of
		 files with ecaplay would cause the system to run
		 out of file descriptors (too many open files error)
	- fixed: bug in handling LADSPA plugins with colon chars in 
		 their port descriptions (such as the SC1-4 
		 compressors)
	- fixed: do not print "Session created" even if -q option has

		 so that all lines fit into 74 columns; does not affect
		 wellformed output mode nor stderr output (-D)
	- added: new section about handling commas in filenames to 
		 Ecasound User's Guide
	- added: eiam - new 'int-log-history' command to query 
	 	 recent log messages sent by libecasound; this is a very

	- added: eiam - new 'int-set-log-history-length' command to set
		 log history length; default to 5 items
	- added: resample-lq (low-quality) audio object to force using
		 the internal resampler even though support for
		 libsamplerate is enabled at build time

		 the old average mixing is still the default; see
	 	 ecasound(1)
	- added: ecasoundrc - 'mix-mode' setting; see ecasoundrc(5)
	- changed: more helpful messages to explain why a chainsetup 
		   cannot be connected to the engine
	- changed: EIAM - when returning a list of strings, all commas
		   in list elements are now escaped with backslashes; 
		   this is done to avoid ambiguity in parsing
	- changed: new default debug level of 271
	- changed: new optimized message queue implementation used in
	           communication between the engine and the interface 
		   subsystems; solves a few remaining corner cases 
		   where ecasound could block in real-time critical 
		   code-paths

	- fixex: setting radius params of -etc comb filter
	- fixed: make check target failed in readline-4.0 subdir
	- fixed: avoid segfault when receiving a bufsize or srate
		 change event from JACK; ecasound still cannot change 
		 bufsize or srate on the fly, but at least it now fails 
		 gracefully
	- fixed: always pass filename (%f) as one parameter to the 
		 external apps; fixes bug present in 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 
		 releases which broke handling spaces in filenames; 
		 affected all file formats handled via external tools 
		 (ogg/mp3/flac/m4a/...); also a separate bug in handling
		 spaces in ogg output filenames was fixed
	- fixed: occasional bugs with rubyecasound in handling the
		 EIAM 'quit' command; this also fixes the errors in 
		 running 'make check' in ecasound/rubyecasound
	- fixed: serious bugs in resampling between 96000 and 44100/48000 
		 rates when using libsamplerate; upgraded Ecasound to use
		 the libsamplerate 'full API'
	- fixed: options "-b:", "-b" and "-b:0" caused a segfault
	- fixed: aac/m4a encoder was not stopped properly after 
		 processing was finished

	- fixed: ogg input failed if requested sample-format had non-native
		 endianess; new default-cmd for ogg-input, see 
		 ecasoundrc(5)
	- fixed: build failed on MacOSX/freebsd because of undefined 	
		 mlockall and related defines
	- fixed: errors in ecasound(1) man page and the examples.html;
	         adding chain operators to multiple chains at once
		 is not supported anymore
	- fixed: engine state not fully updated after a 'run' 
		 command has completed; caused commands such as
		 'cs-set-position' to fail when used after 'run'
	- fixed: ecasound sample formats s24_le/_be were mapped
		 to 4-byte ALSA formats S24_LE/_BE; now mapped
		 to the correct 3-byte S24_3LE/_3BE formats
	- fixed: bug in C ECI impl that caused sync-loss errors between
		 ECI clients and the engine [jesse]
	- fixed: ECI session corruption after processing 'long int' 
		 return values [jesse]

		 yes if ruby interpreter found on the system
	- added: resampling examples to Documentation/examples.html
	- changed: increased default buffer sizes for 'rtnull' objects 
		   to avoid too many xrun warnings; warnings are also
		   no longer printed to stderr - instead a summary 
		   is printed at the end of the session if any xruns
		   have occured
	- changed: Ecasound PDF docs (user's, programmer's and ECI 
		   guides) are now generated using AE fonts; the PDFs

		   probably look better in others [janweil]
	- fixed: pyecasound/test1_stresstest.py was not included in
		 the dist package
	- fixed: libaudiofile - input file audio parameters

	- changed: ecasound.el updated to 0.8.3, lots of small
		   changes, see ecasound.el for details [mlang]
	- changed: pyecasound - due to bugs found in the native python
		   impl, the C ECI impl is again set as the default; 
		   can be overridden using --enable-pyecasound=IMPL
	- changed: pyecasound - the native python impl (ecacontrol.py)
		   now returns an error if communication with the
                   ecasound process times out
	- changed: html versions of programmer's, user's and ECI 
                   developer's guide are generated with Hevea instead

		       ever implemented
	- note: verified to compile ok with gcc-3.3
	- note: verified to work with python-2.3
	- added: eaim - command 'engine-launch' to inialize engine

		 for halting it without disconnecting; useful with
		 JACK transport functions
	- added: separate AUTHORS file; also added to the website
	- added: -d, -dd and -d command-line options, see ecasound(1)
	- added: recording offset parameter -z:multitrack,offset option
	- changed: to avoid resampling faults, upper limit of 2000%

	- changed: if available, use pthread API for setting scheduler 
		   params; might improve real-time reliability on 
		   rh9.0 machines and others that have NPTL
	- changed: pyecasound - redefined configure option 
		   --enable-pyecasound=IMPL where 'IMPL' is either
		   'c' or 'python'; --disable-pyecasound disables 
		   them both
	- changed: pyecasound - if ecasound's build prefix does not
		   match the python prefix, /usr or /usr/local, 
 		   pyecasound will be disabled; you can override 
		   this by specifying the python module directory 
		   explicitly with the --with-python-modules=DIR 
		   option
	- changed: JACK transport support code to the new API 
		   introduced in 0.76.1 and newer
	- changed: ecasound.spec; added 'AUTHORS'
	- changed: JACK transport modes redefined; new modes are

		   against libartcs actually works before enabling 
  		   the arts plugin
	- fixed: use of the JACK transport API was never actually 
                 enabled in 2.2.3
	- fixed: .aiff/.snd/.au input/output was not working at all
  	 	 due to a typo in source code
	- fixed: a chain with a short input file could cause a nasty
 		 feedback loop if processed with certain effects 
		 and mixed with audio from other chains
	- fixed: ewf length and offset errors with sample rates 
		 different from default (usually 44.1kHz)
	- fixed: chainsetup samplerate incorrectly set with some
	 	 configurations; caused problems with -t:xxx and 
		 other functions related to chainsetup level position 
		 and length
	- fixed: serious bug in mixing down multiple chains with
 		 different number of channels to one output; audio 
		 from previous mixdown rounds leaked to unused 
		 source channels
	- fixed: some chainsetup parsing errors were totally ignored 
		 and not reported to the user
	- fixed: eiam - output of map-* commands was broken in 
		 certain locales (for example "fi_FI")
	- fixed: without at least one '-Md' or one '-km' option 
		 specified, MIDI-services did not work
	- fixed: pulse gate timing inaccuracy (-eemp); also affected
		 the bpm pulse gate (-eemb) and thus the metronome
		 preset (-pn:metronome)
	- fixed: a 'setpos' on a not yet connected chainsetup would
		 cause seeks to the wrong position for objects with 
		 non-default samplerates
	- fixed: pay regard to -z:multitrack and -z:nomultitrack when
		 saving chainsetups to .ecs files
27042003 (v2.2.3)  -** stable release **-
	- added: support for both -0.64 and 0.65- JACK versions; 
		 transport functionality is only enabled with the 
		 newer versions
	- added: automatic query of child object sample rate by 
		 giving 'auto' as 2nd arg to resample object
	- changed: by default python version of ECI is used; the C 
		   python module for ECI, pyecasound, is only compiled
		   if --enable-pyecasound is specified
	- changed: jack_auto,dstclient input/output object now 
		   automatically connects to matching ports of JACK
		   dstclient (no longer requires dstclient to have
		   in_X/out_X port names)
	- fixed: yet another fix for creating temporary files in
                 ecanormalize and ecafixdc; now both LOGNAME and USER
		 are checked for a valid user name
	- fixed: prefer usleep over nanosleep on cygwin; avoids 
		 the excessive-cpu-usage problem
	- fixed: work-around for a bug in the pcm plugin of ALSA 0.9.1
		 and earlier that caused recording/playback to
		 stop to an audio i/o error
	- fixed: inconsistencies in how configure --disable/enable-feat
		 options were handled
	- fixed: if pyecasound was disabled at build time, make
		 install target failed in ecasound/pyecasound

	- added: alternative UNIX signal handling for platforms that
		 don't provide sigwait() (cygwin is one)
	- changed: ecasoundrc - ladspa-plugin-directory can contain 
		   multiple directories, separated by colons; this

		   much faster and reliable transport-sync
	- fixed: compiling pyecasound failed on alpha w/ gcc-3.2

	- fixed: controller source positions were not always updated
	         when global chainsetup position was changed
	- fixed: controllers weren't properly initialized before use;
		 this bug caused real harm only to -klg objects; 
		 only the first defined -klg worked as expected
	- fixed: increased the max message size in ECI-standalone;
		 ecasetupedit-0.2.3 caused the parsing buffers to

	- changed: ecasound now uses the new JACK (0.40.0 and newer) 
	           ALSA PCM port names (alsa_pcm:capture_X and 
		   alsa_pcm:playback_X)
	- changed: number of channels must be given as the first
	           parameter to -ezx; this was needed to implement
		   true multichannel support
	- changed: syntax used for JACK inputs/outputs, see 
		   ecasound(1) and ecasound user's guide for 
		   details
	- changed: ecasound JACK transport master mode now follows

		 and 'ctrl-status'
19102002 (v2.2.0-pre3)

24062002 (v2.1dev10)
	- added: -G:mgrtype,optstring switch for setting 
		 audio object manager level options

	- added: reverse audio object type; see the ecasound(1) 
		 man page for better documentation
	- added: pyecasound - if python version is 2.2 or higher, 
		 pyeca.py sets custom dlopen flags before importing
	         the actual pyecasound python module; this makes it
		 possible to access ecasound's plugins (ALSA, JACK,
	         libaudiofile) from python ECI apps
	- added: ecasoundrc - 'default-audio-format'; same syntax
 		 as with the -f option; defaults to s16_le,2,44100,i
	- added: edi-18 implemented; engine samplerate is now
		 set automatically - if object sample rates don't
	         match, an error is printed
	- added: edi-21 implemented; a much improved framework 
		 for handling audio position information is now
  		 in place; -kl, -kl2 and -klg are now position

		   to pyecasound.so
	- changed: programmer's guide updated; added a new chapter
		   about library organization
	- changed: minor user's guide update
	- changed: looping with -tl always loops from the start; 
		   -y can't be used for setting the loop start 
 		   offset -> ewf-files should be used instead
	- changed: s24_le and s24_be sample formats are interpreted
		   as three-byte values, not as four-byte 
		   24-in-32bits values as before; to access 
		   unpacked 24bit data, use s32_le and s32_be
		   formats instead
	- changed: configure.in cleanup
	- changed: the libkvutils binary API has changes so its
	           version number was changed from 3:0:1 to 3:0:0
                   (libkvutils.so.3); this interface will be
		   frozen together with libecasound.so.8
	- changed: rewritten rtnull implementation; now imitates
		   soundcard behaviour much more accurately
	- changed: numerous portability improvements to the 
	           autoconf scripts
	- changed: new rpm-spec file; libraries are now located
	 	   in separate rpm-packages
	- changed: ecasound-config renamed to libecasoundX-config
	- changed: ecasoundc-config renamed to libecasoundcX-config
	- changed: libecasound headers are now installed to

	           to incdir/libecasoundc
	- changed: plugin directory name from prefix/lib/ecasound-plugins
	           to prefix/lib/libecasoundX-plugins, where X is
	           the library interface number

		 first command
	- fixed: after mp3/ogg/mikmod/timidity objects had reached
		 finished state, playback couldn't be started 
		 without doing a disconnect-connect
	- fixed: better handling of situations where JACK server
		 is abruptly shutdown and then restarted
	- fixed: sometimes an incorrect length-field was written to 
		 newly created wav-files 
	- fixed: problems with using ewf-files with doublebuffering
	- fixed: loop devices didn't work; resulted in 'explicit 
		 exception' errors
	- fixed: configure failed if neither ncurses nor termcap
		 was installed
	- fixed: compile failed if ALSA was not installed (even
		 with --disable-alsa)
	- fixed: if compiled with --with-largefile, when closing 
		 output wav files, riff header block was written
		 over start of audio data
	- fixed: -eemb wasn't working properly, this broke the
	         'metronome' preset
	- fixed: recording offset not set when not in 
		 multitrack mode
	- fixed: incorrect parsing of wav headers on big-endian 
	         machines
	- fixed: various small fixes to make ecasound compile 
		 with Sun's Workshop6 C5.2 C++ compiler under
		 64bit Solaris 2.8 (sparc ultra-250)
	- fixed: ecasoundrc - ext-cmd-text-editor and 
		 ext-cmd-wave-editor were incorrectly parsed
	- fixed: cs-edit didn't preserve chainsetup position
	- fixed: cs-edit discarded all changes if the original
		 chainsetup was connected but the resulting
		 setup was not valid for reconnection
	- fixed: -klg didn't work as documented
16012002 (v2.1dev7)
	- edi-entries: edi-12
	- added: a watchdog thread that handles thread cleanup; 
	 	 this is needed especially for audio and chainop
 	         objects which create their own threads (like jack)
	- changed: unification of interactive and passive 
                   modes; running ecasound without -c is now
		   pretty close to "echo run | ecasound -c cmds"
	- changed: if an invalid chainsetup is given on the command
	           line, and -c is given, ecasound will print an 
		   error but will not exit as it did before; you 
		   can continue editing in the ia-mode to check 
 		   what was wrong in the setup
	- changed: compilation of eca-iamode-parser.cpp is now 
		   significantly faster and takes less resources;
		   this should fix problems with compiling ecasound 
                   on machines with <256MB of memory
	- fixed: audio-manager.h was missing from the dist-package
	- fixed: critical bug that prevented writing to 
 		 double-buffered non-realtime output objects
	- fixed: chainsetups with multiple controller objects of
		 the same type didn't work in 2.1dev6 [jesse]
	- fixed: edi-12 - multichannel, noninterleaved ALSA 0.9 input
		 and output not working properly
22122001 (v2.1dev6)
	- edi-entries: edi-8, edi-11, edi-17
	- note: review of all samplebuffer-related code; 
		lots of code-cleanups and minor improvements
	- added: edi-11; hierarchy-based config file system; 
		 default values now stored to 
		 '{prefix}/share/ecasound/ecasoundrc' while
		 individual values can be overridden in 
		 '~/.ecasound/ecasoundrc'
	- added: bitrate (kbps) params to mp3 and ogg outputs
	- added: initial JACK support; enable by giving
		 --with-jack=install_prefix configure option
	- added: edi-8; ia-mode - support for parsing args 
	         containing white-space; either by quoting
	         with ("a token") or backslash espacing 
	         (a\ token) [junichi]
	- removed: ecasoundrc - 'user-resource-directory' tag 
                   removed; user-specific preset/oscillator 
		   definition directory now '~/.ecasound'
	- changed: ecasoundrc - to avoid versioning conflicts, 
		   all 'ext-*' tags are renamed; see ecasoundrc(5)
	- changed: 'make install' will now overwrite old 
		   data files ({prefix}/share/ecasound/*)
	- fixed: problems with automake1.5
	- fixed: eiam - 'ao-get-position' returned an integer 
		 value instead of a float as it should
	- fixed: bugs with combining -ei and LADSPA plugins
	- fixed: 2.1dev5 wrote broken wav-headers
	- fixed: minor changes to posix signal handling
	- fixed: seg.faults with -ei:x where x < 50

		 parameter)
	- added: support for describing preset parameters (edi-3)
	- changed: pyecasound - makefile-hack that allows pyecasound
		   to work even though compiled against libecasound

	- added: chainsetup parser prints a warning if an unknown
	         buffering mode is given to -B:mode

		   eca-controller.h for details)
101199 (v1.6.1d6)

140999 (v1.5.12r6)  -** public release **-
	- fixed: problems with libaudiofile (.aiff and .au/.snd
	         support)
	- fixed: extra noise when upsampling
	- fixed: qtecasound - chainsetup's name was changed to
		 tempfile name if edited with an external editor
	- fixed: qtecasound - conflict with Qt-libs when 
		 stopping processing (resulted in abort) 
120999 (v1.5.11r5)
	- added: ldconfig is now always run after (un)install of 
	         binary RPM packages
	- added: if underruns/overruns occur when using ALSA devices,
	         a warning message is given on exit (stderr)
	- changed: gcc's -fomit-frame-pointer isn't used anymore
	           (caused lots of problems with exceptions)
	- fixed: ecasound tried to use ALSA headers even though 
	         --disable-alsa was given (eca-alsa-dyn.h and
	         eca-midi.h)
	- fixed: audiofx_compressor.h tried to include obsolete
	         error.h header file
	- fixed: pan effect (-epp) decreased overall volume level
	- fixed: fake-stereo effect (-etf) wasn't working properly
	- fixed: "make install" created (prefix)/share/ecasound
		 with permission mode 644 (only root could access
		 the directory)
	- fixed: some problems with effect option parsing
	- removed: simple lowpass filter (-ef2)
070999 (v1.5.10r5)
	- added: qtecasound - file dialogs now remember the current
		 directory
	- added: a much more elegant system for dynamically loading 
		 ALSA support
	- added: support for ALSA MIDI devices (/dev/snd/midiCxDy)
	- changed: rewrote the MIDI-input sybsystem (works better
		   with multiple controllers)
	- fixed: kvutils -package also needed configure script fixes 
		 to recognise FreeBSD's pthread implementation
	- fixed: although "make install" worked in all cases,
		 plain "make" didn't work if installing ecasound 
		 1.5.x for the first time
	- fixed: crashed if you had two chainsetups with ALSA devices
	         and you tried to delete the other one
	- fixed: crashed in some conditions when closing .wav and 
		 .raw files
040999 (v1.5.9r5)
	- changed: qtecasound - in all windows with list widgets,
	           if no item is selected, current item (if any) 
		   is used for all operations
	- changed: in most cases, '-r' option (raise priority) isn't 
		   needed anymore (see ecasound and ecasoundrc man
		   pages for more info)
	- changed ecasoundrc - 'x-text-editor-use-getenv' is now
		  'true' by default
	- fixed: resonant lowpass filter was once again broken
	- fixed: configure should now recognise FreeBSD's pthread
		 implementation (not tested yet)
	- fixed: in some rare cases, engine was started in interactive 
		 mixmode while the interface was in passive mode 
	         (-> program started but didn't do anything)
030999 (v1.5.8r5)
	- added: '!' shortcut to all windows (keyboard focus to 
		 control panel)
	- changed: some Makefile changes for excluding static
		   ecasound libraries from the binary dist packages
		   (managed to shrink binary-rpms by nearly a 1MB!)
	- fixed: qtecasound - shortcut-key fixes in chainsetup window
	- fixed: qtecasound - waveform view positioning is now much 
		 more precise than before
	- fixed: qtecasound - core dumps when exiting
020999 (v1.5.7r5)
	- added: qtecasound - chainsetup window now has a wave-edit
		 button which loads the active file into a external
		 wave editor; defaults to "snd", can be changed by 
		 changing the value of "x-wave-editor" in 
		 ~/.ecasoundrc 
	- added: qtecasound - support for external text editors 
	         (can be launched from session window) - saves the 
	         active chainsetup to a text file, loads it to an 
                 editor and afterwards updates file's content back 
		 to ecasound - if "x-text-editor-use-getenv true"
	         is specified in ~/.ecasoundrc, ecasound uses 
		 EDITOR environment variable if it's available, 
	         otherwise value of "x-default-text-editor" is 
	         used ... an of course, default value for this is
		 the ultimate musicians tool: emacs! ;) 
	- changed: qtecasound - some minor changes to session and 
	 	   chainsetup widgets
	- changed: .ews format (wave view cache files) has changed,
		   ecasound can still read the old format
	- changed: qtecasound - "activate" button changed to a
		   "change status" button which rotates through 
 		   inactive->active->connected->inactive ...
	- fixed: qtecasound - enabling/disabling chains sometimes
                 resulted in program crashes
	- fixed: all structs found in ecasound source code now 
		 use the standard type definations from sys/type.h 
		 (format "[u_]int'bits'_t") - this should solve some 
		 compatibility problems with non-x86 platforms - 
		 thanks for Guenter Geiger for notifying about these
	- fixed: a few fixes to the new double-buffering system -
		 lots of buffer parameter fine-tuning 
290899 (v1.5.6r5) 
	- added: "-z:feature" command line option for enabling 
		 misc features
	- added: mmap-based double-buffering now disabled by 
		 default, enable it with "-z:db" or by putting 
		 "default-to-double-buffering true" to your 
		 ~/.ecasoundrc
	- added: when upgrading ecasound, new resource values 
		 will be automatically added to your ~/.ecasoundrc
        - fixed: crashes when getting error messages from alsa-lib
		 (for instance when using invalid card and device
		 numbers)
	- fixed: a few Makefile problems in 1.5.x versions 
	     	 (thanks for Vadim Tkachenko for reporting these)
280899 (v1.5.5r5) 
	- added: improvements to resource file (~/.ecasoundrc) 
	         handling - resource files can now have comment
	         lines (lines beginning with a '#'); resource
                 files are rewritten only if resource values are 
		 changed directly from ecasound; '=' sign can be 
		 used as a name-value separator
	- fixed: since version 1.5.2r5, .cdr input/output hasn't
		 worked (reversed byteorder when reading .crd 
	         files, .cdr output files weren't padded correctly)
270899 (v1.5.4r5) 
	- added: experimental support for double-buffered 
		 mmap() file i/o (currently implemented 
		 for .wav/.raw input only)
	- fixed: thread-priority was always risen (once again) 
210899 (v1.5.3r5) 
	- added: a lowpass filter effect (-ef2); not as good 
	  	 as the other lowpass filters (-efl and -ef3), but
		 should be a bit faster
	- fixed: 1.5.2r5 was really _slow_ (a file seek bug)
200899 (v1.5.2r5) 
	- added: "-x" command line option - truncate outputs
	- added: sample rate conversion (resampling) - if audio 
		 object's sample rate differs from ecasound's
		 internal rate the signal gets resampled 
		 (internal rate is currently 44100; can be 
		 changed from samplebuffer.h)
	- changed: gcc 2.95.1 is now used when developing 
		   ecasound; precompiled packages require libstdc++ 
		   2.10.0 (comes with gcc 2.95.1) or newer
	- fixed: few minor fixes to the noisegate effect
	- fixed: upon creation, more precision is used to print
		 effect parameters
190899 (v1.5.1r5) 
	- fixed: problems with filters
180899 (v1.5.0r5) 
	- added: ecatools package which now consists of programs
		 ecatools_normalize, ecatools_fixdc and 
		 ecatools_play - see ecatools(1) man page
 	- changed: ecasound and qtecasound now have their own 
	           source trees; rest of ecasound is compiled
	    	   into the libecasound.so shared library
	- changed: to make ecasound relocatable, preset files are now
		   installed to standard data dir (defaults to 
		   /usr/local/share/ecasound)
	- changed: lot of source file name changes
	- changed: ALSA support (libasound.so library) is now loaded
	 	   dynamically at runtime
	- fixed: you had to have yodl installed to to install ecasound 
		 man pages
150899 (v1.4.6r5)  -** public release **-
	- added: qtecasound - along with some other improvements, 
	         waveform widget now uses cache files to store 
	         wave statistics; for file "somefile.wav", cache
	         file "somefile.wav.ews" is used
	- fixed: reading and writing aiff files works again;
		 some aiff files created with sox still seem to 
		 cause trouble (might be a problem with 
		 libaudiofile)
	- fixed: qtecasound - a nasty mutex bug which caused ecasound
		 to crash if you tried to use a chainsetup which has
	         more inputs than chains
120899 (v1.4.5r4):
	- added: qtecasound - dialogs for adding, removing and 
		 attaching inputs and outputs 
	- added: support for null inputs/outputs
	- added: effect status is now printed when exiting ecasound
	         (doesn't affect interactive mode)
	- added: if OSS drivers for your soundcard don't support 
		 trigger functions, you can disable these with 
		 configure option "--disable-osstrigger"
	- added: -ev effect (analyze sample data) now also tells
		 how much the analyzed signal can be amplified 
	         without clipping
	- added: debug level can now be set in iactive mode with 
		 "debug level" command
	- changed: qtecasound - shortcuts a, A and ctrl-a now do 
		   the same thing; applies to all shortcuts
	- fixed: adding a chain without a valid output resulted in 
		 hangs when using multithreaded mixmode
	- fixed: didn't compile with alsa-lib versions older than 0.3.1
	- fixed: "ecasound -h" dumped core
010899 (v1.4.4r4)
	- added: qtecasound - now asks for a name when adding chainsetups
	- added: qtecasound - adding and deleting chains
	- changed: some layout changes
290799 (v1.4.3r4)
	- changed: if format supports it, outputs are now opened in 
		   read-write mode; currently supported by .wav, 
		   .cdr and .raw; when you use these as outputs, files 
		   aren't truncated if they exist
	- fixed: qtecasound - active chainsetup was always saved even 
		 if some other chainsetup was selected
	- fixed: qtecasound - crashed if you changed the active 
		 chainsetup and you had a waveform window open
	- fixed: qtecasound - crashed if tried to activate 
	         a invalid chainsetup
	- fixed: if you wrote to a output file, its length was 
		 not changed (from ecasound's viewpoint)
270799 (v1.4.2r4)
	- fixed: samplebuffer.h still tried to include <soundcard.h>,
		 which is both not necessary and a wrong place to 
  	 	 look for it; thanks to Torbjorn Tornkvist and 
		 Xavier Hosxe for notifying me
	- fixed: qtecasound - using multithreaded mixmode, changing 
		 chainsetups on the fly caused a lot of problems
	- fixed: qtecasound - shortcut keys didn't work with CLI
270799 (v1.4.1r4)
	- added: qtecasound - chain widget now monitors effect
		 parameters
	- added: qtecasound - support for double clicks and return
		 presses for various widgets
	- added: qtecasound - some new features to the waveform widget
	- changed: from now on, interactive mode isn't automatically 
		   enabled, if a realtime input is specified
	- changed: names of some functions (I'm trying to be careful
	           how I use 'new' and 'add', 'load' and 'open', etc
	- fixed: qtecasound - waveform widget crashed qtecasound if
		 the analyzed file had less than 76800 samples 
	- fixed: if processing was completed and was restarted without 
	         a rewind/setpos, ecasound crashed/hang
	- fixed: raised-priority mode was sometimes enabled even
		 without the -r option 
	- fixed: qtecasound - when using multithreaded mixmode, 
		 exiting sometimes resulted in core dump or segfault
250799 (v1.4.0r4)
	- added: qtecasound - waveform widget; graphical representation
	         for input/output objects
	- added: qtecasound - chain widget; view chain status 
	- added: qtecasound - chainsetup widget; status of input,
		 output and chain objects, enable/disable chains
	- added: qtecasound - session-setup widget; load and save
	         chainsetups, create new ones, etc
	- changed: can now be started without a valid chainsetup if 
		   interactive mode is enabled
	- fixed: *serious bug* if end of input was reached,
		 that input remained silent until ecasound was 
		 restarted (has been broken since 1.3.0r3)
240799 (v1.3.3r4)
	- added: -n option, sets chainsetup's name
230799 (v1.3.2r4)
	- added: a new compressor - thanks for Viktor Endersz for
		 sending it to me and John S. Dyson for coding it; 
	         it really works like a dream! (option -eca) 
	- fixed: some fixes to my old compressor (now that we 
		 have a better one, this should be used only if 
		 you really want brutal results :))
	- fixed: due to some changes in ALSA libs, ecasound 
		 wouldn't compile with ALSA versions >0.3.2;
		 haven't tested it, but should now work with both 
		 new and old ALSA libs
200799 (v1.3.1r4)  -** public release **-
	- fixed: delay effect was broken; while fixing this I also 
		 added a new surround mode, 2 = stereo-spread
	- fixed: more bugs with ALSA and OSS input routines; 
	         did some multitrack recording with both of them 
		 and got suprisingly good results (it seems that
	         finding the optimal buffer size is the key to success)
190799 (v1.3.0r3)
	- added: support for sessions and chainsetups; now you can 
	         store the whole runtime setup to an ascii file and
	         load it back; the syntax used is exactly the 
		 same as the command line syntax so editing these 
		 saved chainsetup files is easy
	- added: "-s[:]filename" command line option for loading 
	         chainsetup files 
	- added: "load filename" and "save filename" commands to 
	         the interactive-mode (for chainsetups)
	- added: support for libaudiofile (SGI audiofile) library;
		 new file formats: .aiff, .au and .snd; (linking to 
  		 audiofile can be prevented with --disable-audiofile
	         option to the configure script)
	- added: -q option (quiet mode), disables all output
	- added: support for raw/headerless (.raw) input/output files
	- added: support for using standard system input and output
		 streams (-i:stdin, -o:stdout)
	- added: finished the man pages, all important options and
		 features should now be covered
	- fixed: file name ending with a upper-case extension 
		 wasn't recognised
	- fixed: when using multithreaded mixmode with complex setups,
		 threads sometimes went out of sync causing strange
	         behaviour
	- changed: size of sample buffer objects can now be changed
	           on-the-fly (output files are not aligned to 
 		   buffersize anymore) -> this makes ecasound more 
		   usable as a format conversion tool
	- changed: compressor wasn't working, decided to code
	           a new one (still experimental but works better
		   than the last one)
140799 (v1.2.3r3)
	- added: support for .mp2 files
	- fixed: still some bugs in selecting mixmode
	- fixed: automatic stereo-mono conversion wasn't working 
		 at all (as all chains are internally stereo, this 
		 occured everytime you specified a mono output, even
		 if the input was mono, too)
130799 (v1.2.2r3)
	- added: ALSA devices can now also be opened by specifying 
		 the actual device name (/dev/snd/pcm...)
	- changed: default output is now always attached to chain 'all'
	- fixed: start/stop/forward/rewind with ALSA-output sometimes 
		 resulted in loud crackle
	- fixed: some bugs in the position slider of qtecasound
	- fixed: 'noise-gate-mono' effect was rewritten as it didn't 
		 seem to work very well
120799 (v1.2.1r3)  -** public release **-
	- added: 'make install' now creates /etc/ecasound directory 
		 and copies all the configuration/preset files 
		 to this directory (existing files/dirs are skipped)
	- added: lots of crash-guards to command line parsing 
	- added: frequently-asked-questions file (both txt and html)
	- added: new options to the configure script: --disable-alsa,
		 --disable-oss and --disable-qt
	- fixed: bugs in mixmode multithreaded-iactive (crashed
		 pretty much everytime)
	- fixed: estatus output was sometimes pretty messy
110799 (v1.2.0r2)
	- added: support for ALSA input/output 
	- added: a lot of new documentation to the man pages
	- added: new configurable options to ~/.ecasoundrc 
		 (default-buffersize, default-to-interactive-mode,
		 default-to-raisepriority)
	- added: finally implemented the 'help' command in
  	         the interactive-mode; also added a prompt, which 
                 should help a bit :)
	- added: autoconf and automake additions; now qtecasound is 
		 compiled only if qt library is found, OSS and 
                 ALSA modules are compiled if the necessary 
                 headers and libraries are available
	- added: support for single-chain effect presets (-ps command 
		 line option)
	- fixed: bugs with OSS-input (device was sometimes closed 
                 multiple times resulting in core dumps)
	- fixed: auto-runmode used 'simple-iactive' mixmode
                 although iactive-mode wasn't set
	- fixed: looping wasn't working properly
	- fixed: -m option wasn't working
	- removed: simple filter effect (not really useful)
	- removed: 'Waiting for the processing thread'
		   messagebox (qtecasound)
100799 (v1.1.8r2)
	- fixed: more synchronisation bugs
050799 (v1.1.6r2)
	- added: rewrote the man-pages using Yodl; now they're 
 		 also available in HTML-format 
	- fixed: OSS-output module used a non-standard location
		 for soundcard.h (noticed by D.Phillips)
010799 (v1.1.5r2)  -** public release **-
	- tested: did some real recording and mixing work with this 
	          version and after a few fixes, everything seems
	          to work ok
	- added: now checks whether a chainop supports parameter
		 controlling or not 
	- added: a lot of new documentation (especially to 
		 'Documentation/examples.html')
	- fixed: chain 'all' wasn't working properly
	- fixed: multitrack chain synchronization was broken; should 
		 now work even with complex setups
	- fixed: a serious bug in OSS-input: ecasound always threw 
 		 an "read-error" exception when trying to read from
		 OSS input
	- fixed: analyze effect (-ev) output didn't work
300699 (v1.1.4r1)  -** public release **-
	- notice! first release; should be considered beta
	- fixed: if mp3 files had white-spaces in their filenames, 
	         filenames weren't interpreted correctly
250699 (v1.1.3r0)
	- more bug fixes
	- tested rpm-packaging and seemed to work ok
230699 (v1.1.2r0)
	- bug fixes 
190699 (v1.1.1r0)
       	- fixed: some bugs in exception handling 
       	- qtecasound: added a not-implemented message screen! ;)
180699 (v1.1.0r0)
       	- all major features of ecasound v0.9.x and earlier are 
          now implemented to the new program design 
       	- support for gates (time crop gate and threshold gate
          implemented)
       	- support for ~/.ecasoundrc configuration file
       	- support for GNU autoconf and automake
       	- added some new command line shortcuts
       	- qtecasound: added a position slider widget (displays and
		      enables to change current position)
       	- qtecasound: removed waveform and volume meter widgets;
		      they will reappear in the "Chain Setup" 
		      window (still under work)
160699 (v1.0.8r0)
       	- mp3 output support (using lame) 
150699 (v1.0.7r0)
       	- fixed: waveform -output now works with all inputs 
                (for instance showing mp3 waveforms is now possible)
       	- routines for interfacing with mpg123 recoded; 
          a lot more stable than before
       	- qtecasound now uses the new qt library (v2.0beta2)
       	- support for various controllers (sine oscillator, MIDI 
          cc-controllers, generic oscillator etc)
       	- fixed: when ecasound was stopped with ctrl-c or kill, 
                 proper cleanup wasn't done
100699 (v1.0.6r0)
       	- a new wave-form view 
080699 (v1.0.5r0)
       	- multitrack-mode sync-routines rewritten and tested
       	- various mixmode bugs fixed
040699 (v1.0.4r0)
       	- simple graphical vu-meters added to test the new io-system
030699 (v1.0.3r0):
       	- multithread-io mode: one chain can be processed and mixed 
         while waiting for getting data from other chains	
020699 (v1.0.2r0):
       	- a better way to deal with system endianess
       	- new chain-operator routines; unless there are no no chainops, 
          signal is always put through a clip control routine which 
          ensures that all sample values fit the value range
010699 (v1.0.1r0)
        - fixed a _lot_ of bugs
310599 (v1.0.0r0)
        - changed version numbering
        - major changes in nearly all program modules aiming at 
          a more modular and abstract design

        - support for multitrack recording
        - independent effect chains
        - interactive command-line-interface (CLI)
        - looping (loop, loop_start, loop_end)
        - new debug -system
        - man -pages
311098 (v0.80)
        - support for MIDI-controllers
        - now uses glibc v2.0 and linuxthread libraries
041098 (v0.70)
        - began to upkeep this history file
        - fixing the gate-functions
---
1998:    - changed development platform from Os/2 to Linux
1997-98: - complete rewrite in C++; name changed from "wavstat" to "ecasound"
1995-97: - started working with this project; original program
           was called "wavstat" and it basicly was just
           a very simple command line DSP util (running under Os/2)
