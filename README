=================   Airtime - Live Broadcast Together   =================
=========================================================================

Airtime is an open source application that provides remote and 
collaborative automation of a broadcast station.

Home page: http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/

Major features:

 * Web-based remote station management. Authorized personnel can add
   programme material, create playlists or smart blocks, and stream in live, 
   all via a web interface.
 * Automation. Airtime has a scheduler function that enables users to
   create shows with content for playback at the exact date and time specified. 
   Playlists, smart blocks and remote stream URLs can be used multiple times.
 * Solid playout. Airtime uses the open source Liquidsoap streaming language 
   for reliable and precise playback to multiple outputs. 
 * Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
   all parts of the program code, under the GNU GPLv3 license.
