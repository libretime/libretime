=================   Airtime - Live Broadcast Together   =================
=========================================================================

Airtime is an open source application that provides remote and 
collaborative automation of a broadcast station.

Home page: http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/airtime/

Major features:

 * Web-based remote station management. Authorized personnel can add
   programme material, create playlists or smart blocks, and stream in live, 
   all via a web interface.
 * Automation. Airtime has a scheduler function that enables users to
   create shows with content for playback at the exact date and time specified. 
   Playlists, smart blocks and remote stream URLs can be used multiple times.
 * Solid playout. Airtime uses the open source Liquidsoap streaming language 
   for reliable and precise playback to multiple outputs. 
 * Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
   all parts of the program code, under the GNU AGPLv3 license.


INSTALLATION
------------

Please see this chapter to begin a typical installation:
http://sourcefabric.booktype.pro/airtime-25-for-broadcasters/preparing-the-server/

If you are a developer, please see this page:
http://wiki.sourcefabric.org/display/CC/Airtime+Dev+Site

Basic installation has two steps:

1) Run the install script, located in the Airtime/installer directory.

    cd installer

For an interactive installation, run:

    sudo ./install

The installer will then prompt you about how you want to set up your Airtime installation.

For a simple full installation (setting up apache and postgres configurations and users for you), run

    sudo ./install -fap

What this means:

    -f - force; non-interactive (no prompts)
    -a - install the default apache setup for Airtime
    -p - create a default Airtime postgres user

This will install all components necessary for Airtime, and set up /usr/share/airtime as your
web root (where apache looks for your Airtime files).

There are several options for installation - to see them all, run

    sudo ./install --help

2) Once you've run the installer, navigate to localhost/ (if you have a custom apache configuration, navigate to
your Airtime web host) to run an interactive setup.

If you just want to run Airtime with default settings, you won't need to change anything, but if you have any custom
configuration settings you'll be able to specify them.

Once you finish the setup process, you'll be presented with a configuration checklist so you can ensure that
your Airtime installation is working correctly. If anything was mis-configured, the checklist will provide some
helpful tips to resolve the issue.

If your checklist is all green, you're ready to get started with Airtime!
