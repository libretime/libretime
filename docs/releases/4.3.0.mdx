## :arrow_up: Upgrading

### Docker legacy volume

When deploying using Docker, the legacy volume is not updated automatically.
This results in fixes to the legacy service not being run by docker compose. The
`libretime_assets` volume must be deleted before the upgrade. The bug is tracked
in https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues/3150.

```bash
docker volume rm libretime_assets
```
