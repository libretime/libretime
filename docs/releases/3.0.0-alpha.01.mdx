## :fire: Deprecation and removal

- The `ubuntu` Vagrant box has been replaced with `ubuntu-xenial` and `ubuntu-trusty`. The `debian` box has been replaced with `debian-jessie` and `debian-wheezy`. Users of the old boxes should switch to a new box so we can drop the old box after this release.

## :warning: Known issues

The following issues need a workaround for the time being. Please search the [issues](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues) before reporting problems not listed below.

### Outdated silan reports unreliable cue in/out information

Out of the box the installer installs a broken, outdated version of silan on all Debian based Platforms (ie. Ubuntu). This affects all distros supported by the installer except CentOS which doesn't have upstream packages and you may either install from source or use the [0.3.3 packages](https://github.com/radiorabe/centos-rpm-silan) from [RaBe APEL](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:radiorabe:audio).

You can check the version of silan by running with `silan --version` which should report `0.3.3` or with `sudo dpkg -s silan | awk '/Version/ {print $2}'` that will show the exact package version you installed. Please include this information if you file bugs concerning silan.

There are multiple workarounds to this issue and [a bug against the upstream](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=855319) has been opened with Debian. Until this is sorted you should pre-install silan from a source you trust. If your distro hasn't updated to 0.3.3 yet you can also help by asking your distros maintainers for a bump.

The following solutions have been reported to work.

#### Silan from OBS build (https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues/177#issuecomment-299195796)

Works for all relevant Debian and Ubuntu distros and installs silan `0.3.3~nmu1`.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

# install package signing key from obs
wget -qO- https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hairmare:/silan/Debian_7.0/Release.key \
  | apt-key add -

# add OBS repo to sources list (pick the distro you need)

# Debian Wheezy
echo 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hairmare:/silan/Debian_7.0 ./' \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hairmare_silan.list
# Debian Jessie
echo 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hairmare:/silan/Debian_8.0 ./' \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hairmare_silan.list
# Ubuntu Trusty
echo 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hairmare:/silan/xUbuntu_14.04 ./' \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hairmare_silan.list
# Ubuntu Xenial
echo 'deb https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/hairmare:/silan/xUbuntu_16.04 ./' \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hairmare_silan.list

# update local package database
apt-get update

# install silan 0.3.3 from obs packages
apt-get install silan
```

#### Legacy upstream silan packages (https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues/197)

Legacy Upstream hosts patched packages for Ubuntu Trusty on `apt.sourcefabric.org`. They install as `0.3.2~trusty~sfo-1`.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https

sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list <<EOD
deb https://apt.sourcefabric.org/ trusty main
EOD

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sourcefabric-keyring
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --reinstall silan=0.3.2~trusty~sfo-1
```
