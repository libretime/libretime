## :arrow_up: Upgrading

### Analyzer certificate verification

Analyzer no longer ignore certificate verification when performing a request. We recommend using Let's Encrypt to get a certificate. If you do rely on self signed certificate, please read the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/) documentation to provide a CA Bundle to verify the cert using environment variables.

### Analyzer new command line interface

The Analyzer command line interface has been reworked and uses new flags.

- `--debug` flag becomes `--log-level <level>`
- `--rmq-config-file` flag becomes `--config <filepath>`
- `--http-retry-queue-file` flag becomes `--retry-queue-filepath`.
- `retry-queue-filepath` default value changed from `/tmp/airtime_analyzer_http_retries` to `retry_queue` in the working directory.

### New configuration schema and validation

The configuration file parsing was improved with validation and the configuration schema was updated. Some deprecated fields were removed and other were renamed.

The `general` section has been changed:

- the `general.web_server_user` entry was removed
- the `general.cache_ahead_hours` entry now defaults to 1
- the `general.airtime_dir` entry is deprecated and can be removed
- the `general.station_id` entry is deprecated and can be removed
- the `general.protocol` (`http` or `https`) entry is recommended over the `general.force_ssl` entry.
- the `general.force_ssl` entry should either be removed or set to a value (`true` or `false`), an empty value will fail validation.

The storage (`current_backend`) section has been changed:

- the `current_backend.storage_backend` entry now defaults to the only valid value `file`.

:::note

You can remove the entire `current_backend` section from your configuration file.

:::

The `database` section has been changed:

- the `database.*` entries now have defaults
- the `database.port` entry was added and defaults to `5432`
- the `database.dbname` entry was renamed to `database.name`
- the `database.dbuser` entry was renamed to `database.user`
- the `database.dbpass` entry was renamed to `database.password`

The `rabbitmq` section has been changed:

- the `rabbitmq.*` entries now have defaults

The `pypo` section has been changed:

- the `pypo` section was renamed to `playout`
- the `pypo.ls_*` entries were renamed to `playout.liquidsoap_*`
- the `pypo.*_dir` entries were removed
- the `pypo.api_client` entry was removed
- the `pypo.record_file_type` entry was renamed to `playout.record_file_format`
- the `pypo.base_recorded_files` entry was removed
- the `pypo.poll_interval` entry was removed
- the `pypo.push_interval` entry was removed
- the `pypo.cue_style` entry was removed

The deprecated sections `monit` and `facebook` are unused, they can be removed from your configuration file.

Unless you use a custom auth mechanism, the `ldap` section can be removed from your configuration file.

Remove any quoted values in your configuration file, validation might fail otherwise. See the following example:

```ini
# The previously quoted value
ls_port = '1234'
# should become
liquidsoap_port = 1234
```

Please see the [configuration documentation](../admin-manual/configuration.md) for more details.

### Environment variables

The API configuration environment variables names changed:

- `LIBRETIME_CONF_DIR` was removed
- `LIBRETIME_CONF_FILE` was renamed to `LIBRETIME_CONFIG_FILEPATH`

The Analayzer configuration environment variables names changed:

- `LIBRETIME_CONF_DIR` environment variable was replaced with `LIBRETIME_CONFIG_FILEPATH`.

The Worker configuration environment variables names changed:

- `RMQ_CONFIG_FILE` was renamed to `LIBRETIME_CONFIG_FILEPATH`.

### Log files new paths

When running Playout from the command line, the service won't log to a file by default.
When running Playout as a systemd service, the log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/pypo/pypo.log` to `/var/log/libretime/playout.log`

The Playout Notify log file at `/var/log/airtime/pypo-liquidsoap/notify.log` was removed and merged into the existing `/var/log/libretime/liquidsoap.log` log file.

When running Liquidsoap from the command line, the service won't log to a file by default.
When running Liquidsoap as a systemd service, the log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/pypo-liquidsoap/ls_script.log` to `/var/log/libretime/liquidsoap.log`

The Legacy log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/zendphp.log` to `/var/log/libretime/legacy.log`

The API log file moved from `/var/log/airtime/api.log` to `/var/log/libretime/api.log`

Run the following command to create the new and clean the old log directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/libretime
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/libretime

sudo rm -rf /var/log/airtime
```

### Services new working directories

When running Playout as a systemd service, the working directory changed from `/var/tmp/airtime/pypo/` to `/var/lib/libretime/playout`. When running from the command line, the users current working directory is now used by default.

When running Liquidsoap as a systemd service, the working directory is now `/var/lib/libretime/playout`. When running from the command line, the users current working directory is now used by default.

When running Analyzer as a systemd service, the working directory is now `/var/lib/libretime/analyzer`.

When running Worker (celery) as a systemd service, the working directory changed from `/srv/airtime` to `/var/lib/libretime/worker`.

Run the following command to clean the old directory:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/airtime/pypo/
```

### Analyzer new `ffmpeg` based steps

The Analyzer now requires `ffmpeg`. The `silan` system dependency and the `rgain3` python package and it's system dependencies can be removed.

Run the following command to clean the old packages:

```bash
sudo apt purge silan

sudo apt purge \
    gir1.2-gtk-3.0 \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \
    pkg-config \
    python3-cairo \
    python3-dev \
    python3-gi \
    python3-gi-cairo \
    python3-gst-1.0
sudo pip3 uninstall rgain3
```

### No static files for the API

The API doesn't rely on static files in production anymore.

Run the following command to clean the old files:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/airtime/api
```

## :warning: Known issues

The following issues may need a workaround for the time being. Please search the [issues](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues) before reporting problems not listed below.

### Ubuntu 18.04 Playout Status

The playout status notifications in the web interface aren't working. The issue
is tracked in [#1606](https://github.com/libretime/libretime/issues/1606). The
playout works correctly and can be heard in Icecast, however the **On Air**
button is greyed out and the status reported on the **Streams** status page can
report errors connecting to Liquidsoap. The current workaround is to upgrade the
server to Ubuntu 20.04.
