## :arrow_up: Upgrading

### Nginx configuration deployment

The installer now only deploy the Nginx configuration during the first installation. This is to prevent overwriting changes made by Certbot for example. If you need to update the Nginx configuration, you need to pass the `--update-nginx` flag to the installer.
