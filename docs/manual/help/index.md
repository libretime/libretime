Airtime needs your input to improve.

Create a bug report by selecting **Create Issue**, then **Airtime**, and then **Bug**. That way, the Airtime team can keep track of your problem and notify you when it has been fixed. You can also suggest improvements and new features for Airtime on that site.

The UNESCO publication [*Community Radio - A user's guide to the technology*](static/CommunityRadioUserGuide.pdf) features a very comprehensive guide to setting up a community radio station. This guide is aimed at people thinking about setting up a radio station in India, but includes lots of practical advice that would be useful in any country.
