Install steps for file uploading (do it with appropriate changes):
(PUT method for uploading from behind firewall with resume feature)
1) mkdir cgi-bin-put in apache2 dir
2) move put.cgi there from var subdir
3) add to apache2 config (i.g. commonapache2.conf):

<Location /livesupport/modules/archiveServer/var/trans>
  Script PUT /cgi-bin-put/put.cgi
</Location>
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin-put/ "/usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin-put/"
<Directory /usr/local/apache2/cgi-bin-put>
    AllowOverride All
    Options ExecCGI
    <IfModule mod_access.c>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </IfModule>
</Directory>

4) reload apache2

Tested with apache 2.0.49 and (without Directory tag) with apache 1.3.28.

----

For devel environment follow steps in storageServer/doc/INSTALL.
For running archiveServer on different HW then storageServer:
 - required packages: apache, php, mod_php, postgreSQL, PEAR_DB
 - check if PEAR DB installed: 'pear list' or install it: 'pear install DB'
 - check if include_path in php.ini points to PEAR too
   (/usr/lib/php or /usr/local/lib/php)
 - setup var/conf.php - at least "basic configuration" part
 - run 'make check' to: setup directories, create db tables and run test scripts
   OR 'make all' without tests
