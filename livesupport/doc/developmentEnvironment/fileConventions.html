<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes the conventions used for files in the
LiveSupport project.<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
To facilitate cooperation between multiple contributors, it is
advisable to have common file conventions, so as the result of
different peoples work have a uniform look and form. This document
lists the file conventions for the different file formats used by the
project.<br>
<br>
Where the description of the conventions is ambiguous, the examples
given are binding, and are to be followed.<br>
<h1>Generic conventions</h1>
In general, all documents have the following structure:<br>
<ul>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>partition1</li>
  <li>partition2</li>
  <li>...</li>
  <li>partitionN</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="header"></a>header<br>
</h2>
The header of the file holds:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a reference to the LiveSupport project itself</li>
  <li>copyright information</li>
  <li>reference to the license of the file</li>
  <li>the latest author of the file</li>
  <li>the current version of the file</li>
  <li>the full location of the file in the configuration management
system<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Following the GNU GPL <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html#SEC4">guidelines</a> on
applying a license term to source files, the typical header for a text
file looks like the following:<br>
<br>

Note the CVS keywords (as an example) for having up-to-date information
on the author, version and location of the file.<br>
<h2>partitions</h2>
Each file is split into separate partitions, and maintains its
structure with the fixed sequence of these partitions. File formats
differ heavily on the capabilities of defining partitions - some have
explicit support (like HTML with headers and paragraphs), while in some
the commenting feature can be used to visually split up the file (like
comments in source code).<br>
<br>
The exact nature and sequence of the partitions is dependent on the
nature of the file itself.<br>
<h2><a name="textConventions"></a>Generic text-based conventions</h2>
The majority (if not) all sources files are text-based. As a general
rule, text-based files adhere to the following conventions in the
LiveSupport project:<br>
<h3>UTF-8</h3>
Whenever possible, the text files should be saved in the <a
 href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#UTF_8">UTF-8</a> character
encoding, to enable all characters within covered by the Unicode
character set.<br>
<h3>80 columns</h3>
Don't exceed 80 columns for any line in the file, unless it's
absolutely necessary (like having a single expression over 80 columns
that can not be broken up by a new-line character).<br>
<h3>no tabs - 4 spaces</h3>
Don't use the tab character in text files - use 4 spaces instead for
indentation.<br>
<h1>Specific conventions</h1>
For specific file conventions, see the separate descriptions below.<br>

<h2>C++ files</h2>

files.<br>
