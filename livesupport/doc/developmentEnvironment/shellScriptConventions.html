<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes the shell script file conventions for the
LiveSupport
project. See also the generic description of the <a
 href="file:///home/darkeye/src/livesupport/livesupport/doc/developmentEnvironment/fileConventions.html">file
conventions</a> in the LiveSupport
project.<br>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
Shell scripts are text-based executable shell command files. As text
based files, they should adhere to the <a
 href="fileConventions.html#textConventions">generic text-based
conventions</a>.<br>
<h1>Naming</h1>
Shell script files are named by the following rules:<br>
<ul>
  <li>there are no spaces in the file name</li>
  <li>the file name begins with a lower case letter</li>
  <li>for file names containing multiple words, each additional word
begins with a capital letter</li>
  <li>the extension of the file is <code>.sh</code><br>
  </li>
</ul>
For example, a file with a single-word name may be named like: <code>single.sh</code>,
whereas a file with multiple word name would be like: <code>multipleWordNameFile.sh</code>.<br>
<h1>Structure</h1>
Shell script files are partitioned by using the following 80 column
wide partitioning comment:<br>
<pre>#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br># This is the title of the partition<br>#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></pre>
The file has the
following mandatory structure:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Reference to the shell<br>
  </li>
  <li>Header</li>
  <li>Additional sections+</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reference to the shell<br>
</h2>
This is the mandatory reference to the shell executable each script has
to begin with:<br>
<pre><code>#!/bin/sh</code><br></pre>
<h2>Header</h2>
The header holds all information mandated by the <a
 href="fileConventions.html#header">generic guidelines</a>, but
starting with the shell comment character <code>#</code>. Note the 80
column wide partitioning delimiter enclosing the header.<br>

<h2>Additional sections</h2>
Additional sections contain the executing code of the script. Bigger
parts of the script may be partitioned by the partitioning commend seen
above.<br>
