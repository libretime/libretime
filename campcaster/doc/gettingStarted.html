<h1>Scope</h1>
This document describes how to set up the Campcaster development
environment.<br>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
Campcaster uses a well-defined <a
 href="developmentEnvironment/index.html">development environment</a>.
Most of the Campcaster-specific files are included in the version
control system, but some preparation and setup has to be made on system
used to develop Campcaster as well.<br>
<br>
There is a simplified and Ubuntu-centric version of this document in the
<a href="http://trac.campware.org/campcaster/wiki/DevelopmentEnvironment">
Campcaster Trac wiki</a>.

<h1>Steps<br>
</h1>
The following steps needed to be taken for setting up the Campcaster
development environment.<br>
<ul>
  <li>install development tools<br>
  </li>
  <li>set up additional system resources</li>
  <li>check out the sources</li>
  <li>configure the environment<br>
  </li>
  <li>set up tools used by Campcaster</li>
  <li>personalize your development environment<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Install development tools</h2>
Install all the tools needed for the development of Campcaster. Please
see the <a href="developmentTools.html">development tools</a> document
for a list of tools needed.<br>
<h2>Set up additional system resources</h2>
The Campcaster development environment uses some system resources,
that are not reasonable to include in the environment itself.<br>
<h3>Test database<br>
</h3>
One such
resource is an ODBC datasource to a test database. This
database has to be accessible for executing the test suites and
applications within the Campcaster development environment.<br>
<br>
First, Campcaster expects a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>
database, and an ODBC
Data Source accessible to it through <a href="http://www.unixodbc.org/">unixODBC</a>.
Please refer to the documentation of these tools to set them up.<br>
<br>
The test environment assumes that it can connect to the PostgreSQL
database as localhost via a TCP/IP connection, as the user test.<br>
<br>
In newer versions of PostgreSQL (&ge; 8), TCP/IP connections from localhost
are enabled by default. If you are using an older version, do the following:
<ul>
    <li>edit <code>postgresql.conf</code>
    (usually <code>/var/lib/postgres/data/postgresql.conf</code>), to have
    to following line:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>tcpip_socket = true</code></pre>
<br>
    <li> and also edit <code>pg_hba.conf</code> (usually
    <code>/var/lib/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf</code>)
    to include the following line, before other lines related to access
    through localhost:<br>
<br>
<pre><code>host&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 255.255.255.255&nbsp;&nbsp; password</code></pre>
<br>
After the above two manual edits to the PostgreSQL configuration,
restart the postgresql daemon.<br>
</ul>


<h3>Web server<br>
</h3>
Second, Campcaster expects:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> httpd server
running on the development computer</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> interpreter</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> apache module</li>
  <li> PHP iconv extension (--with-iconv)<br>
  <li><a href="http://www.php.net/domxml">DOMXML</a> PHP extension - an
XMLv2 module for PHP<br>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> support in PHP</li>
  <li><a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Apache group membership</h3>
The setup script assumes that the current user is a member of the Apache group.
Add the user who will be using the development environment to this group;
it's usually called <code>apache</code>; on debian-based systems, it is
called <code>www-data</code>.

<h3>Apache configuration</h3>
The storage server uses some directives which are not enabled by default.
To enable them, find the configuration file for the userdir module of
apache, and change the <code>AllowOverride</code> directive in the
<code>&lt;Directory /home/*/public_html&gt;</code> section to <code>All</code>.
<br><br>

<h2>Check out the sources</h2>
The Campcaster development directory tree can be accessed anonymously via
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>, at
<code>svn://source.campware.org/campcaster/trunk/campcaster</code>.
The following Subversion command
would check out the development tree:<br><br>
<pre><code>svn checkout svn://source.campware.org/campcaster/trunk/campcaster</code></pre><br>
This will check out and create the Campcaster development <a
 href="developmentEnvironment/directoryStructure.html">directory
structure</a>.<br>
<br>

<h2>Configure the environment</h2>
First, you need to create the database and ODBC data source used by
Campcaster.  This is done most easily by running the script
<code>campcaster/bin/user_setup_db.sh</code>.
Run the scripts as root, and provide your user name with the
<code>--user</code> option:

<pre><code>
cd campcaster
sudo ./bin/user_setup_db.sh --user=&lt;ls_developer_user&gt;
</code></pre>
<br>
The script will set up the following resources:<br>
<ul>
  <li>a PostgreSQL user named <code>test</code> with the password
        <code>test</code> (if it does not exist)</li>
  <li>a PostgreSQL database named
        <code>Campcaster-&lt;ls_developer_user&gt;</code></li>
  <li>an ODBC data source of the same name, with user name
        and password <code>test</code></li>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>

Next (and last), you compile the code and set up the configuration files.
Both are done by the script
<pre><code>
cd campcaster
./bin/setupDevelopmentEnvironment.sh --apache-group=&lt;apache_group&gt;
</code></pre>
<br>
This script will set up the libraries used by Campcaster (by compiling
and installing them under campcaster/usr), and set up the development
environment for all Campcaster modules.<br>
<br>
It will also create your personalized configuration files under
<code>~/.campcaster</code>, make certain directories writable for Apache
(this is where we need the current user to be a member of the
<code>apache</code> group), define a user-specific port for the scheduler
daemon, and create a symlink in <code>~/public_html/</code> to the PHP
entry points.<br>
<br>
After running the above script, the campcaster development environment
for the current user will be unique on the system, and will not
conflict with resources used by other developers. For example, the
Campcaster HTML user interface for the user will be reachable at:<br>
<pre><code>
http://localhost/~&lt;ls_developer_user&gt;/campcaster/htmlUI/var
</code></pre>
<br>

<h2>Single-user setup</h2>
It is also possible to set up a shared configuration, instead of the
per-user setup described in the previous section.<br>
<br>
To do this, use the script <code>test_setup_db.sh</code> instead of
<code>user_setup_db.sh</code>.  You will also need to manually execute
the commands in <code>setupDevelopmentEnvironment</code> up to, and not
including, the call to <code>user_setup.sh</code>; and manually execute
the "Setup storage server" and "Setup directory permissions" portions
of the <code>user_setup.sh</code> script.  Finally, create a symlink
<code>campcaster</code> in the root data directory of the Apache server
which points to <code>campcaster/src/modules/</code>.
The address of the HTML interface will now be<br>
<pre><code>
http://localhost/campcaster/htmlUI/var
</code></pre>
<br>
After this, the development environment should work, using the default
configuration files.  NOTE: this single-user method has not been used by any
developers for quite some time, so these instructions may be
out of date or incomplete.<br>
<br>

<h1>Ready to roll</h1>
With the above steps completed, the Campcaster modules and products
are ready to be compiled and developed further. Have fun!<br>
