Campcaster is the first free and open radio management software that 
provides live studio broadcast capabilities as well as remote automation
in one integrated system.

Campcaster has three audio outputs: one for live broadcasting, one for
previewing audio, and one for automated scheduled playback.

Major features of Campcaster:
 * Live, in-studio playout.  Campcaster Studio enables station personnel
   to play out both individual sound files and playlists such as 
   advertising blocks or entire programs.
 * Web-based remote station management.  Authorized personnel can add
   program material, create playlists, and schedule programming all via 
   Campcaster's web interface.
 * Automation.  Campcaster has a scheduler function that enables users to
   set playlists for playback at a date and time of their choosing.
   Playlists can be played back multiple times.
 * Playlists.  Campcaster allows users to create playlists that can be 
   either played on-demand in the Studio or in automated mode.  Playlists
   can be nested inside each other, so for example, a playlist with a 
   block of ads can be inside of a playlist with a music program.
 * Centralized archives of station program material.  Station personnel
   have a searchable, browseable central archive that is accessible both
   in the office and via the web.
 * Solid, fast playback.  Campcaster uses the popular Gstreamer 
   multimedia framework for clean, reliable, fast playback. 
 * Program sharing.  Stations can share both playlists and files with a 
   designated, centralized 'network hub.'  This enables the creation of 
   'virtual radio networks' connected via the Internet. 
 * Search-based backup.  You can backup all station archives at the click
   of a button, or only backup certain files based on search terms, so 
   that backup files can be made of only a certain program or of all 
   files created by a certain user.
 * Localization.  Campcaster is multilingual and supports Unicode.  It
   also is very easy to create language localizations.
 * No restrictions.  Multiple instances of the Campcaster Studio program 
   can access the same archive on the office network, and there are no 
   worries about hardware dongles or keys limiting access on multiple PCs.
 * Innovative design.  Campcaster's user interface – the product of 
   Parsons School of Design's “Design and Communication” program -  
   introduces a number of innovations, including the 'Scratchpad', 
   a list of recently-used files and playlists.
 * Open, extensible architecture.  Stations are free to extend and alter 
   all parts of the Campcaster program code, which makes extensive use 
   of XML-RPC APIs.
