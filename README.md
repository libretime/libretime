LibreTime makes it easy to run your own online or terrestrial radio station. It
is a community managed fork of the AirTime project.

It is managed by a friendly inclusive community of stations from around the
globe that use, document and improve LibreTime. Join us in fixing bugs and in
defining how we manage the codebase going forward.

Check out the [documentation](https://libretime.org/docs/) for more information and
start broadcasting!
