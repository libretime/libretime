.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP 
\fBecasoundrc\fP is the main configuration file for ecasound\&. 
Any user-specific modification should be done to 
$HOME/\&.ecasound/ecasoundrc, not to the global resource file\&. Ecasound 
also allows to disable the normal policy and only read from a specific
resource file (see ecasound (1) and documentation for the \fB-R\fP option)\&.
.PP 
The format is quite simple\&. One line consists of 
a configuration variable and its value\&. Variable and value 
are separated with either \&'=\&' or \&' \&'\&. Lines beginning with a
"#" are ignored (comment lines)\&. 
.PP 
.SH "VARIABLES"

.PP 
.IP "midi-device"
MIDI-device\&. If the device name is given in \fIrawmidi,/dev/midi*\fP 
format, OSS/Linux or OSS/Lite drivers are used\&. 
Device \fIrawmidi,/dev/snd/midiCxDy\fP opens an ALSA raw-MIDI 
device with card number \&'x\&' and device number \&'y\&'\&. 
See ecasound (1) man page (the \&'-Md option) for more info\&.
Defaults to \fIrawmidi,/dev/midi\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default-output"
Output device to use by default\&. If a chainsetup with zero
outputs, but with one or more inputs, is connected, a default output
is added and all the chains are connected to it\&. If the special-case
value \&'autodetect\&' is specified, ecasound will try to auto-detect 
a suitable device (JACK -> ALSA -> OSS -> rtnull)\&. 
Defaults to \fIautodetect\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default-audio-format"
Default values for sample format, channel count, sampling rate
and channel interleaving\&. Syntax is the same as used by
ecasound\&'s \fI-f\fP option (see ecasound (1))\&. 
Defaults to \fIs16_le,2,44100,i\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default-to-precise-sample-rates"
Whether to ignore sample rate differences (and possibly avoid 
resampling)\&. Currently only affects OSS-devices\&. Defaults to \fIfalse\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "default-mix-mode"
If \fIdefault-mix-mode\fP is \fIsum\fP, engine will mix multiple channels into
one output channel by summing all input channels\&. In mode \fIavg\fP, 
mixing is done by taking the average of all input channels\&. The
\fIavg\fP mode is safe from clipping, while \fIsum\fP is closer
to the way analog mixers work\&. Defaults to \fIavg\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode-defaults-nonrt"
Selects the default parameters to use with buffering 
mode \&'nonrt\&' (other modes are \&'rt\&' and \&'rtlowlatency)\&. 
Parameters are given as a comma-separated tuple of values:
1) buffersize (number,-b), 2) raised priority (true/false,-r), 
3) sched_priority (number,-r:X), 4) double buffering
(true/false,-z:db), 5) db-bufsize (number,-z:db,X), and
6) max intbuf (true/false,-z:intbuf)\&. Defaults to
\fI1024,false,50,false,100000,true\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode-defaults-rt"
See \&'bmode-defaults-nonrt\&'\&. Defaults to 
\fI1024,true,50,true,100000,true\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "bmode-defaults-rtlowlatency"
See \&'bmode-defaults-nonrt\&'\&. Defaults to 
\fI256,true,50,true,100000,false\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource-directory"
Directory for global ecasound configuration files\&. 
Defaults to \fI{prefix-dir}/share/ecasound\fP\&.
Note! User-specific resource files can be be stored 
to \&'$(HOME)/\&.ecasound/\&'\&. For instance you can 
add your own presets definitions to 
\&'$(HOME)/\&.ecasound/effect_presets\&'\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource-file-genosc-envelopes"
Configuration file for generic oscillators\&. Is located in the 
resource directory\&. Defaults to \fIgeneric_oscillators\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "resource-file-effect-presets"
Configuration file for effect presets\&. Is located in the 
resource directory\&. Defaults to \fIeffect_presets\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ladspa-plugin-directory"
Directory containing LADSPA effect plugins\&. Defaults to \fI{prefix-dir}/lib/ladspa\fP\&.
If environment variable \fILADSPA_PATH\fP exists, directories
specified in it are automatically searched for plugins\&.
Note! To match the syntax of the \fILADSPA_PATH\fP environment 
variable, \&'ladspa-plugin-directory\&' can contain multiple
directories, separated by \&':\&' characters\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-text-editor"
If \fIext-cmd-text-editor-use-getenv\fP is \fIfalse\fP or "EDITOR" 
is null, value of this field is used\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-text-editor-use-getenv"
Should ecasound try to query environment variable "EDITOR"\&.
Defaults to \fItrue\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-mp3-input"
Command for starting mp3 input\&. Ecasound expects to read signed,
16bit, little-endian stereo audio samples from its standard
input\&. Ecsound will query other audio format parameters by parsing 
the mp3 file header\&. Before execution, %f is replaced with
path to the input mp3\&. If exists, "%o" is replaced with he
start offset in mp3 frames\&. Double-quotes and backslash-espacing 
can be used to include white-space to individual parameters\&.
By default, \fImpg123\fP is launched\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-mp3-output"
Command for starting mp3 output\&. Ecasound will write stereo, 
signed, 16bit, little-endian samples to standard output\&. Sample
rate is configurable\&. Before execution, %f is replaced with 
path to the output mp3, %S with sample rate in kHz, and 
%B with encoding bitrate in kbps\&. Double-quotes and 
backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to 
individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will try to
launch \fIlame\fP\&. As a special exception (added to Ecasound
2\&.7\&.0), if the output program is "lame" and options 
include "--big-endian", Ecasound will detect this and output
big-endian samples\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-ogg-input"
Command for starting Ogg Vorbis input\&. Ecasound expects that audio samples
are written to standard output\&. It should be noted that
Ecasound is not able to query the audio format parameters from
ogg files, so these need to be set manually by the user\&.
Before execution, %f is replaced with path to the input ogg\&. 
Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space 
to individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will try to
launch (ogg123)\&.

format parameters, and %B with encoding bitrate in kbps\&.
Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be used to include white-space to 
individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will try to

be used to include white-space to individual parameters\&.
By default Ecasound will try to launch \fItimidity\fP\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-flac-input"
Command for starting FLAC input\&. Ecasound expects that audio samples
are written to standard output\&. It should be noted that
Ecasound is not able to query the audio format parameters from
FLAC files, so these need to be set manually by the user\&. 
Before execution, %f is replaced with path to the input FLAC
file\&. Double-quotes and backslash-espacing can be used to include 
white-space to individual parameters\&. By default Ecasound will

format parameters, %I with either \&'signed\&' or \&'unsigned\&', and
%E with either \&'little\&' or \&'big\&'\&. Double-quotes and backslash-espacing 
can be used to include white-space to individual parameters\&. By default 
Ecasound will try to launch (flac)\&.
.IP 
.IP "ext-cmd-aac-input"
Command for starting AAC input\&. Ecasound expects that signed,
16bit, stereo, big-endian audio samplesare written to standard 
output\&. It should be noted that	Ecasound is not able to query
